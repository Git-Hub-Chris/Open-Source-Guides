Manually running a workflow
To manually run a workflow, you can configure your workflow to use the workflow_dispatch event. This enables a "Run workflow" button on the Actions tab.

  workflow_dispatch:
For more information, see "Manually running a workflow."

Running your jobs on different operating systems
GitHub Actions provides hosted runners for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

To set the operating system for your job, specify the operating system using runs-on:

jobs:
  my_job:
    name: deploy to staging
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
The available virtual machine types are:

ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-18.04, or ubuntu-16.04
windows-latest or windows-2019
macos-latest or macos-10.15
For more information, see "Virtual environments for GitHub Actions."

Using an action
Actions are reusable units of code that can be built and distributed by anyone on GitHub. You can find a variety of actions in GitHub Marketplace, and also in the official Actions repository.

To use an action, you must specify the repository that contains the action. We also recommend that you specify a Git tag to ensure you are using a released version of the action.

- name: Setup Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  with:
    node-version: '10.x'
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running a command
You can run commands on the job's virtual machine.

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm install
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running a job across a matrix of operating systems and runtime versions
You can automatically run a job across a set of different values, such as different versions of code libraries or operating systems.

For example, this job uses a matrix strategy to run across 3 versions of Node and 3 operating systems:

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on node ${{ matrix.node_version }} and ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node_version: ['8', '10', '12']
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]

New to programming? Python is free and easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will help you to get started quickly.

[[BeginnersGuideChinese|Chinese Translation/中文版入门]]

== New to Python? ==
Read [[BeginnersGuide/Overview]] for a short explanation of what Python is.

== Getting Python ==
Next, install the Python 3 interpreter on your computer. This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming. Mac and Linux distributions may include an outdated version of Python (Python 2), but you should install an updated one (Python 3). See [[BeginnersGuide/Download]] for instructions to download the correct version of Python.

There are also Python interpreter and IDE bundles available, such as [[http://thonny.org|Thonny]]. Other options can be found at IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments.

At some stage, you'll want to edit and save your program code. Take a look at HowToEditPythonCode for some advice and recommendations.

== Learning Python ==
Next, read a tutorial and try some simple experiments with your new Python interpreter.

 * If you have never programmed before, see BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers for a list of suitable tutorials.
 * If you have previous programming experience, consult [[BeginnersGuide/Programmers]], which lists more advanced tutorials.
 * If English isn't your first language, you might be more comfortable with a tutorial that's been translated into your language. Consult python.org's [[Languages|list of Non-English resources]].

Most tutorials assume that you know how to run a program on your computer. If you are using Windows and need help with this, see [[http://www.python.org/doc/faq/windows/#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows|How do I Run a Program Under Windows]].

Some sites offer in-browser coding for those who want to learn Python:

/* please keep this list alphabetized */

 * [[https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python|Codecademy]]

 * [[https://www.codedex.io|Codédex]]

 * [[https://www.coding-bootcamps.com|Coding Bootcamps]]

 * [[https://www.datacamp.com|DataCamp]]

 * [[https://www.dataquest.io|Dataquest]] for Python for data science.

 * [[https://www.hackinscience.org|HackInScience]] free and open source platform.

 * [[https://www.myhsts.org|High School Technology Services]] for general Python

 * [[https://python.land/python-tutorial|Python Land: A completely free beginners tutorial with interactive, editable code examples]]

Print a [[https://blog.finxter.com/python-cheat-sheet/|cheat sheet]] of the most important Python features and post it to your office wall until you know the basics well.

Once you have read a tutorial, you can browse through [[http://docs.python.org|Python's online documentation]]. It includes [[http://docs.python.org/tut/|a tutorial]] that might come in handy, [[http://docs.python.org//lib/|a Library Reference]] that lists all of the modules that come standard with Python, and [[http://docs.python.org/ref/|the Language Reference]] for a complete (if rather dry) explanation of Python's syntax.

When you are ready to write your first program, you will need a [[PythonEditors|text editor]] or an [[IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments|IDE]]. If you don't want to use Thonny or something more advanced, then you can use [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html|IDLE]], which is bundled with Python and supports [[http://idlex.sourceforge.net|extensions]].

This Python wiki also contains a page about [[Powerful Python One-Liners|Python One-Liners]] -- an obscure but interesting subculture in Python.

== Need Help? ==
Need help with any of this? Read [[BeginnersGuide/Help]] for mailing lists and newsgroups.

Most Python books will include an introduction to the language; see IntroductoryBooks for suggested titles.

Consult [[BeginnersGuide/Examples]] for small programs and little snippets of code that can help you learn.

Or, if you prefer to learn Python through listening to a lecture, you can attend a training course or even hire a trainer to come to your company. Consult the PythonEvents page to see if any training courses are scheduled in your area and the PythonTraining page for a list of trainers.

Teachers can join the [[http://www.python.org/sigs/edu-sig/|EDU-SIG]], a mailing list for discussion of Python's use in teaching at any level ranging from K-12 up to university.

Standard +Consider Selling Price +Fair Value Uncertainty +Economic Moat +Stewardship Grade +03-11-2022 1 by Greggory Warren +Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022 +While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

The FBI leads this task force of more than 30 co-located agencies from the Intelligence Community and law enforcement.

If upi, have questions,The TE/GE Office of Federal, State, and Local, Government has oversight for 1099-G filing for government entities. I’ll share how to successfully implement furnishing 1099-Gs electronically, discuss the requirements, and answer questions that many have about the process. Our goal is to provide all the information to help you implement an e-furnishing system for these information returns that complies with the rules and regulations.We all know that our income tax system relies on self-reporting of income, and most Americans depend on receiving and including income reported on various information returns. The likelihood of income being reported properly is greatly improved when information returns are prepared correctly and delivered to payees efficiently.Therefore, the IRS has focused for many years on e-filing and educating payers about e-furnishing to recipients. The Office of Federal State and Local Governments published a web article on this topic, and you can find it by going to IRS.gov and search "requirements for furnishing Form 1099-G electronically". You may want to refer to the article later to review the information provided. It contains many resource links, but the most important one we will be discussing today, which will be mentioned throughout, is Publication 1179, General Rules and Specifications for Substitute Forms 1096, 1098, 1099, 5498, W-2G, and 1042-S.Your best resource for developing a system to electronically furnish information returns is found in Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements on pages 28 and 29 of the publication. As is true with all IRS forms and publications, Publication 1179 can be accessed by going to IRS.gov and selecting 'Forms and Instructions'. You can view forms and publications online, download a PDF, or order hard copies via the Forms and Instructions page.Let's talk about the Form 1099-G, which is an information return that is used by government entities to report certain payments.Government entities are required to file and furnish Form 1099-G if payments were made throughout the year for: unemployment compensation; state or local income tax refunds, credits or offsets; Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance payments; taxable grants; and agricultural payments. You must also file Form 1099-G if you received payments on a commodity credit corporation loan. More details on the types of payments reportable can be found in the instructions for Form 1099-G, also available via IRS.gov.In general, the furnishing requirement is met by providing the recipient or payee with a paper copy of Form 1099-G by January 31 of the year following the year of payment. You must also file a copy of the 1099-G with the IRS before February 28, unless you file electronically, which allows for a due date of March 31st of the same year. The Internal Revenue Code and regulations allow for most information returns to be furnished electronically. +complete: list of allowable return's' ":" found on pages 28 of Pub. 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The 2021 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns specifies who must file information returns, when and where to file them and information about electronic reporting.The instructions also cover correcting and voiding returns, providing statements to recipients, taxpayer identification numbers, backup withholding, penalties and more.With our focus today on furnishing 1099-Gs to recipients electronically what are the incentives to do so?Why migrate to furnishing Form 1099-G electronically to recipients? There are quite a few advantages to it.There may be significant cost benefits that result when paper and printing costs are reduced, mailing processes and fees are reduced if not eliminated, paper handling costs from filing, sorting, storing and shredding are reduced; eliminating re-typing and/or editing of documents reduces costs; and finally, accessibility is a factor. Distribution via secure web access and email is usually most cost-effective and convenient for recipients. How must it be done? In general, organizations will request affirmative consent, receive and document the consent, provide required notifications, and furnish statements to consenting payees electronically.Now let's go into a little more detail on these steps. To use electronic deliveries for information returns to payees, the payer must obtain an affirmative consent from each recipient to whom a statement will be furnished electronically.The consent must be made by the recipient electronically in a way that confirms the recipient can access the statement in the same electronic format in which it will be furnished. For example, if the Form 1099-G will be delivered as a portable document format, or PDF file, then the affirmative consent document format should also be in PDF. In addition, the payer must make certain notifications to each consenting individual. These will be addressed later in the presentation. What does the consent process look like? The first step in the process is to obtain consent from your payees.The procedures that follow were originally included in Revenue Procedure 2004-58 and have been annually updated without material change through and including the current Revenue Procedure 2021-27.You may refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The process begins with correspondence sent to each individual payee, requesting affirmative consent to electronic delivery of their Form 1099-G. The correspondence may be delivered by mail, electronic mail, in person, or via web site posting, and it must provide instructions on how to affirmatively consent.The correspondence must include the following statement in capital letters: "IMPORTANT TAX RETURN DOCUMENT AVAILABLE." If the correspondence is provided by electronic mail, the foregoing statement must be on the subject line of the electronic mail.If the electronic notice is returned as undeliverable and the correct electronic address cannot be obtained from the payee's records, or from the payee, then the furnisher must furnish the notice by mail, or in person, within 30 days after the electronic notice is returned.The following examples for securing consent are found in Regulation 31.6051-1. These examples apply to any electronically furnished information return. Example one: consent is requested via correspondence.The state sends the recipient a letter, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically on a web site, instead of paper.The letter contains instructions explaining how to consent to receive the form electronically, by accessing the web site, downloading the consent document, completing the consent document, and emailing it back to the state.The consent document posted on the web site uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient reads the instructions and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the statements electronically in the manner described in the regulations. Example two: consent is requested via e-mail.The state sends the recipient an e-mail, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The email contains an attachment, instructing the recipient how to consent to receive the form electronically.The e-mail attachment uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient opens the attachment, reads the instructions, and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations.Example three: consent is requested via a web site posting.The state posts a notice on its web site, stating the recipient may receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The web site contains instructions on how the recipient may access a secure web page and consent to receive the statements electronically By accessing the secure web page and giving consent, the recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations. In each case, the payer took the steps to notify recipients by letter, email or web site posting about the availability of a consent election, prior to issuing returns electronically. Electronic statements are furnished to an individual only after that individual responded with an affirmative consent.If the payee does not consent, a paper document must be sent. As part of the consent process, the government entity must provide a statement with all the following notifications prominently displayed. There are seven notifications.Number one is, if the payee does not consent, a paper copy will be provided. Two, the scope and duration of the consent.Three, how to obtain a paper copy after giving consent.Four, how to withdraw the consent. Five, conditions under which an electronic statement will no longer be furnished.Six, procedures to update payee information. And Seven, a description of hardware and software required to access, print and retain a state-ment, and when it will no longer be available.If the government entity makes any hardware or software changes that create a risk that the recipient won't be able to access the statement, a notice of these changes must be provided to the recipient before changing the hardware or software. The notice must inform the recipient that a new consent to receive the form in the revised electronic format must be provided.After implementing the revised hardware and software changes, the furnisher must obtain a new consent or confirmation of consent from the recipient to receive the form electronically.You can refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6.2, Consent. What do you need to do after you have secured consent? The government entity must place electronically posted Forms 1099-G on the applicable web site by January 31, the due date, and the statement must remain available until at least October 15 of that year.When Forms 1099-G are posted, the issuing entity must notify the consenting payees, either electronically or by mail. For payees who do not provide consent, or who withdraw their consent to receive the Form 1099-G electronically before the statement is furnished, the payer must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline.And again, the deadline would be January 31 for the Form 1099-G. As a payor, you should have a record of the payee consent for every statement you furnish electronically. If you fail to furnish the information in the required manner, this could result in the payee neglecting to report the income on their individual federal, state or local income tax returns. And this could subject them to enforcement actions, including penalties and possibly interest, by multiple government taxing authorities on any taxes that were due and owing. The affirmative consent requirement ensures each payee will either receive the statement on paper or agrees to the electronic delivery.Now here are a few reminders. One, the recipient must not have withdrawn the consent before the statement is furnished. Two, if the recipient subsequently withdraws their consent, your system must notify you and a paper reporting requirement must be resumed. You must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline, and again that is January 31 for Form 1099-Gs. Three, remember, a new consent to receive the statement electronically is required after any new hardware or new software is put into service. And four, all electronic statements must be in a format that conforms to the requirements as stated in Publication 1179.The affirmative consent requirements assure a payee knows the information statement will be furnished electronically, they have the right hardware and software to receive the information statement, and if they don't consent, a paper statement will be provided to them. I’ll share a few common questions we receive about this process and the answers next: The first question is, does the consent to receive the statement electronically have to be provided each tax year, or does it stay in effect until the payee withdraws the consent? The answer is the furnisher can make the determination regarding the scope and duration of the consent if the payee is informed. They can decide whether a consent to receive payee statements electronically lasts for each succeeding tax year, unless it is withdrawn or there is a change in hardware or software requirements, or whether the consent is only effective for the first information return required to be furnished following the date the consent is given. Remember, prior to furnishing the statements electronically, you must provide the recipient a statement with prominently displayed notices, including the scope and duration of the consent.The second question is whether the furnisher has met its obligation to furnish the information return if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically but does not actually retrieve the information return?The answer is they've met their obligation to furnish the info return under Internal Revenue Code Sections 6050B(b) and 6050E(b)if the payee affirmatively consents to receive it electronically. Section 401 of the Job Creation and Workers' Assistance Act of 2002 permits the electronic furnishing of all statements required under Section 6041 through 6050W, if the recipient consents to receive the statement in a manner similar to the one permitted by regulations under Section 6051, or in such other manner as provided by the Secretary.The next question is: Does the furnisher have to obtain affirmative consent to furnish the Form 1099-G electronically? The answer is the furnisher must obtain affirmative consent before they may furnish the Form 1099-G electronically.If a furnisher does not obtain affirmative consent, they must furnish the return by paper, or they will be in violation of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations.The fourth question is: Why should the furnisher comply with the affirmative consent requirement?The affirmative consent requirement assures the payee knows the information return or statement will be furnished electronically and has the right hardware and software to receive the information statement. If the payee does not know the statement is furnished electronically or does not have the right hardware and software to receive it electronically, they may not report income when required. This would result in loss of revenue and increased correspondence and compliance costs. Moreover, and this is not to say that the Internal Revenue Service is considering doing this, the legislative history to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 states, the conferees anticipate the Secretary would seriously consider terminating any exchange of returns or return information under Section 6103 with the state that does not report refunds to the taxpayer. This statement was in the House-Senate Conference Report, HR report number 861, at page 992, dated June 23, 1984.Question five is: What does the phrase 'must furnish a Form 1099-G' mean? The answer is the furnisher must either furnish the payee a paper copy of the Form 1099-G or furnish the Form 1099-G electronically by email or on a secure web site, if it has obtained affirmative consent by the payee.The next question is: Is it acceptable to stop mailing Form 1099-G and furnish the form electronically to the recipients? The answer is the furnisher may furnish the information return electronically if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically. Under current regulations, this means furnishing either by email or on a secure web site.And the last question is: What is a Form 4419 and who needs to file it? The answer is a Form 4419, Application for Filing Information Returns Electronically, is submitted by those payers or agents who file information returns with the IRS electronically. Please review the instructions to Form 4419 for information on how to fill out/submit Form 4419 to the IRS.I hope this has helped clarify the procedures to furnish recipients Form 1099-Gs electronically.These procedures include requesting affirmative consents, receiving and documenting consents, providing required notifications, and furnishing statements to consenting payees electronically" %}.

Standard +Consider Selling Price +Fair Value Uncertainty +Economic Moat +Stewardship Grade +03-11-2022 1 by Greggory Warren +Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022 +While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

If upi, have questions,The TE/GE Office of Federal, State, and Local, Government has oversight for 1099-G filing for government entities. I’ll share how to successfully implement furnishing 1099-Gs electronically, discuss the requirements, and answer questions that many have about the process. Our goal is to provide all the information to help you implement an e-furnishing system for these information returns that complies with the rules and regulations.We all know that our income tax system relies on self-reporting of income, and most Americans depend on receiving and including income reported on various information returns. The likelihood of income being reported properly is greatly improved when information returns are prepared correctly and delivered to payees efficiently.Therefore, the IRS has focused for many years on e-filing and educating payers about e-furnishing to recipients. The Office of Federal State and Local Governments published a web article on this topic, and you can find it by going to IRS.gov and search "requirements for furnishing Form 1099-G electronically". You may want to refer to the article later to review the information provided. It contains many resource links, but the most important one we will be discussing today, which will be mentioned throughout, is Publication 1179, General Rules and Specifications for Substitute Forms 1096, 1098, 1099, 5498, W-2G, and 1042-S.Your best resource for developing a system to electronically furnish information returns is found in Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements on pages 28 and 29 of the publication. As is true with all IRS forms and publications, Publication 1179 can be accessed by going to IRS.gov and selecting 'Forms and Instructions'. You can view forms and publications online, download a PDF, or order hard copies via the Forms and Instructions page.Let's talk about the Form 1099-G, which is an information return that is used by government entities to report certain payments.Government entities are required to file and furnish Form 1099-G if payments were made throughout the year for: unemployment compensation; state or local income tax refunds, credits or offsets; Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance payments; taxable grants; and agricultural payments. You must also file Form 1099-G if you received payments on a commodity credit corporation loan. More details on the types of payments reportable can be found in the instructions for Form 1099-G, also available via IRS.gov.In general, the furnishing requirement is met by providing the recipient or payee with a paper copy of Form 1099-G by January 31 of the year following the year of payment. You must also file a copy of the 1099-G with the IRS before February 28, unless you file electronically, which allows for a due date of March 31st of the same year. The Internal Revenue Code and regulations allow for most information returns to be furnished electronically. +complete: list of allowable return's' ":" found on pages 28 of Pub. 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The 2021 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns specifies who must file information returns, when and where to file them and information about electronic reporting.The instructions also cover correcting and voiding returns, providing statements to recipients, taxpayer identification numbers, backup withholding, penalties and more.With our focus today on furnishing 1099-Gs to recipients electronically what are the incentives to do so?Why migrate to furnishing Form 1099-G electronically to recipients? There are quite a few advantages to it.There may be significant cost benefits that result when paper and printing costs are reduced, mailing processes and fees are reduced if not eliminated, paper handling costs from filing, sorting, storing and shredding are reduced; eliminating re-typing and/or editing of documents reduces costs; and finally, accessibility is a factor. Distribution via secure web access and email is usually most cost-effective and convenient for recipients. How must it be done? In general, organizations will request affirmative consent, receive and document the consent, provide required notifications, and furnish statements to consenting payees electronically.Now let's go into a little more detail on these steps. To use electronic deliveries for information returns to payees, the payer must obtain an affirmative consent from each recipient to whom a statement will be furnished electronically.The consent must be made by the recipient electronically in a way that confirms the recipient can access the statement in the same electronic format in which it will be furnished. For example, if the Form 1099-G will be delivered as a portable document format, or PDF file, then the affirmative consent document format should also be in PDF. In addition, the payer must make certain notifications to each consenting individual. These will be addressed later in the presentation. What does the consent process look like? The first step in the process is to obtain consent from your payees.The procedures that follow were originally included in Revenue Procedure 2004-58 and have been annually updated without material change through and including the current Revenue Procedure 2021-27.You may refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The process begins with correspondence sent to each individual payee, requesting affirmative consent to electronic delivery of their Form 1099-G. The correspondence may be delivered by mail, electronic mail, in person, or via web site posting, and it must provide instructions on how to affirmatively consent.The correspondence must include the following statement in capital letters: "IMPORTANT TAX RETURN DOCUMENT AVAILABLE." If the correspondence is provided by electronic mail, the foregoing statement must be on the subject line of the electronic mail.If the electronic notice is returned as undeliverable and the correct electronic address cannot be obtained from the payee's records, or from the payee, then the furnisher must furnish the notice by mail, or in person, within 30 days after the electronic notice is returned.The following examples for securing consent are found in Regulation 31.6051-1. These examples apply to any electronically furnished information return. Example one: consent is requested via correspondence.The state sends the recipient a letter, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically on a web site, instead of paper.The letter contains instructions explaining how to consent to receive the form electronically, by accessing the web site, downloading the consent document, completing the consent document, and emailing it back to the state.The consent document posted on the web site uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient reads the instructions and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the statements electronically in the manner described in the regulations. Example two: consent is requested via e-mail.The state sends the recipient an e-mail, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The email contains an attachment, instructing the recipient how to consent to receive the form electronically.The e-mail attachment uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient opens the attachment, reads the instructions, and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations.Example three: consent is requested via a web site posting.The state posts a notice on its web site, stating the recipient may receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The web site contains instructions on how the recipient may access a secure web page and consent to receive the statements electronically By accessing the secure web page and giving consent, the recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations. In each case, the payer took the steps to notify recipients by letter, email or web site posting about the availability of a consent election, prior to issuing returns electronically. Electronic statements are furnished to an individual only after that individual responded with an affirmative consent.If the payee does not consent, a paper document must be sent. As part of the consent process, the government entity must provide a statement with all the following notifications prominently displayed. There are seven notifications.Number one is, if the payee does not consent, a paper copy will be provided. Two, the scope and duration of the consent.Three, how to obtain a paper copy after giving consent.Four, how to withdraw the consent. Five, conditions under which an electronic statement will no longer be furnished.Six, procedures to update payee information. And Seven, a description of hardware and software required to access, print and retain a state-ment, and when it will no longer be available.If the government entity makes any hardware or software changes that create a risk that the recipient won't be able to access the statement, a notice of these changes must be provided to the recipient before changing the hardware or software. The notice must inform the recipient that a new consent to receive the form in the revised electronic format must be provided.After implementing the revised hardware and software changes, the furnisher must obtain a new consent or confirmation of consent from the recipient to receive the form electronically.You can refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6.2, Consent. What do you need to do after you have secured consent? The government entity must place electronically posted Forms 1099-G on the applicable web site by January 31, the due date, and the statement must remain available until at least October 15 of that year.When Forms 1099-G are posted, the issuing entity must notify the consenting payees, either electronically or by mail. For payees who do not provide consent, or who withdraw their consent to receive the Form 1099-G electronically before the statement is furnished, the payer must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline.And again, the deadline would be January 31 for the Form 1099-G. As a payor, you should have a record of the payee consent for every statement you furnish electronically. If you fail to furnish the information in the required manner, this could result in the payee neglecting to report the income on their individual federal, state or local income tax returns. And this could subject them to enforcement actions, including penalties and possibly interest, by multiple government taxing authorities on any taxes that were due and owing. The affirmative consent requirement ensures each payee will either receive the statement on paper or agrees to the electronic delivery.Now here are a few reminders. One, the recipient must not have withdrawn the consent before the statement is furnished. Two, if the recipient subsequently withdraws their consent, your system must notify you and a paper reporting requirement must be resumed. You must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline, and again that is January 31 for Form 1099-Gs. Three, remember, a new consent to receive the statement electronically is required after any new hardware or new software is put into service. And four, all electronic statements must be in a format that conforms to the requirements as stated in Publication 1179.The affirmative consent requirements assure a payee knows the information statement will be furnished electronically, they have the right hardware and software to receive the information statement, and if they don't consent, a paper statement will be provided to them. I’ll share a few common questions we receive about this process and the answers next: The first question is, does the consent to receive the statement electronically have to be provided each tax year, or does it stay in effect until the payee withdraws the consent? The answer is the furnisher can make the determination regarding the scope and duration of the consent if the payee is informed. They can decide whether a consent to receive payee statements electronically lasts for each succeeding tax year, unless it is withdrawn or there is a change in hardware or software requirements, or whether the consent is only effective for the first information return required to be furnished following the date the consent is given. Remember, prior to furnishing the statements electronically, you must provide the recipient a statement with prominently displayed notices, including the scope and duration of the consent.The second question is whether the furnisher has met its obligation to furnish the information return if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically but does not actually retrieve the information return?The answer is they've met their obligation to furnish the info return under Internal Revenue Code Sections 6050B(b) and 6050E(b)if the payee affirmatively consents to receive it electronically. Section 401 of the Job Creation and Workers' Assistance Act of 2002 permits the electronic furnishing of all statements required under Section 6041 through 6050W, if the recipient consents to receive the statement in a manner similar to the one permitted by regulations under Section 6051, or in such other manner as provided by the Secretary.The next question is: Does the furnisher have to obtain affirmative consent to furnish the Form 1099-G electronically? The answer is the furnisher must obtain affirmative consent before they may furnish the Form 1099-G electronically.If a furnisher does not obtain affirmative consent, they must furnish the return by paper, or they will be in violation of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations.The fourth question is: Why should the furnisher comply with the affirmative consent requirement?The affirmative consent requirement assures the payee knows the information return or statement will be furnished electronically and has the right hardware and software to receive the information statement. If the payee does not know the statement is furnished electronically or does not have the right hardware and software to receive it electronically, they may not report income when required. This would result in loss of revenue and increased correspondence and compliance costs. Moreover, and this is not to say that the Internal Revenue Service is considering doing this, the legislative history to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 states, the conferees anticipate the Secretary would seriously consider terminating any exchange of returns or return information under Section 6103 with the state that does not report refunds to the taxpayer. This statement was in the House-Senate Conference Report, HR report number 861, at page 992, dated June 23, 1984.Question five is: What does the phrase 'must furnish a Form 1099-G' mean? The answer is the furnisher must either furnish the payee a paper copy of the Form 1099-G or furnish the Form 1099-G electronically by email or on a secure web site, if it has obtained affirmative consent by the payee.The next question is: Is it acceptable to stop mailing Form 1099-G and furnish the form electronically to the recipients? The answer is the furnisher may furnish the information return electronically if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically. Under current regulations, this means furnishing either by email or on a secure web site.And the last question is: What is a Form 4419 and who needs to file it? The answer is a Form 4419, Application for Filing Information Returns Electronically, is submitted by those payers or agents who file information returns with the IRS electronically. Please review the instructions to Form 4419 for information on how to fill out/submit Form 4419 to the IRS.I hope this has helped clarify the procedures to furnish recipients Form 1099-Gs electronically.These procedures include requesting affirmative consents, receiving and documenting consents, providing required notifications, and furnishing statements to consenting payees electronically" %}.

Standard +Consider Selling Price +Fair Value Uncertainty +Economic Moat +Stewardship Grade +03-11-2022 1 by Greggory Warren +Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022 +While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

If upi, have questions,The TE/GE Office of Federal, State, and Local, Government has oversight for 1099-G filing for government entities. I’ll share how to successfully implement furnishing 1099-Gs electronically, discuss the requirements, and answer questions that many have about the process. Our goal is to provide all the information to help you implement an e-furnishing system for these information returns that complies with the rules and regulations.We all know that our income tax system relies on self-reporting of income, and most Americans depend on receiving and including income reported on various information returns. The likelihood of income being reported properly is greatly improved when information returns are prepared correctly and delivered to payees efficiently.Therefore, the IRS has focused for many years on e-filing and educating payers about e-furnishing to recipients. The Office of Federal State and Local Governments published a web article on this topic, and you can find it by going to IRS.gov and search "requirements for furnishing Form 1099-G electronically". You may want to refer to the article later to review the information provided. It contains many resource links, but the most important one we will be discussing today, which will be mentioned throughout, is Publication 1179, General Rules and Specifications for Substitute Forms 1096, 1098, 1099, 5498, W-2G, and 1042-S.Your best resource for developing a system to electronically furnish information returns is found in Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements on pages 28 and 29 of the publication. As is true with all IRS forms and publications, Publication 1179 can be accessed by going to IRS.gov and selecting 'Forms and Instructions'. You can view forms and publications online, download a PDF, or order hard copies via the Forms and Instructions page.Let's talk about the Form 1099-G, which is an information return that is used by government entities to report certain payments.Government entities are required to file and furnish Form 1099-G if payments were made throughout the year for: unemployment compensation; state or local income tax refunds, credits or offsets; Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance payments; taxable grants; and agricultural payments. You must also file Form 1099-G if you received payments on a commodity credit corporation loan. More details on the types of payments reportable can be found in the instructions for Form 1099-G, also available via IRS.gov.In general, the furnishing requirement is met by providing the recipient or payee with a paper copy of Form 1099-G by January 31 of the year following the year of payment. You must also file a copy of the 1099-G with the IRS before February 28, unless you file electronically, which allows for a due date of March 31st of the same year. The Internal Revenue Code and regulations allow for most information returns to be furnished electronically. +complete: list of allowable return's' ":" found on pages 28 of Pub. 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The 2021 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns specifies who must file information returns, when and where to file them and information about electronic reporting.The instructions also cover correcting and voiding returns, providing statements to recipients, taxpayer identification numbers, backup withholding, penalties and more.With our focus today on furnishing 1099-Gs to recipients electronically what are the incentives to do so?Why migrate to furnishing Form 1099-G electronically to recipients? There are quite a few advantages to it.There may be significant cost benefits that result when paper and printing costs are reduced, mailing processes and fees are reduced if not eliminated, paper handling costs from filing, sorting, storing and shredding are reduced; eliminating re-typing and/or editing of documents reduces costs; and finally, accessibility is a factor. Distribution via secure web access and email is usually most cost-effective and convenient for recipients. How must it be done? In general, organizations will request affirmative consent, receive and document the consent, provide required notifications, and furnish statements to consenting payees electronically.Now let's go into a little more detail on these steps. To use electronic deliveries for information returns to payees, the payer must obtain an affirmative consent from each recipient to whom a statement will be furnished electronically.The consent must be made by the recipient electronically in a way that confirms the recipient can access the statement in the same electronic format in which it will be furnished. For example, if the Form 1099-G will be delivered as a portable document format, or PDF file, then the affirmative consent document format should also be in PDF. In addition, the payer must make certain notifications to each consenting individual. These will be addressed later in the presentation. What does the consent process look like? The first step in the process is to obtain consent from your payees.The procedures that follow were originally included in Revenue Procedure 2004-58 and have been annually updated without material change through and including the current Revenue Procedure 2021-27.You may refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The process begins with correspondence sent to each individual payee, requesting affirmative consent to electronic delivery of their Form 1099-G. The correspondence may be delivered by mail, electronic mail, in person, or via web site posting, and it must provide instructions on how to affirmatively consent.The correspondence must include the following statement in capital letters: "IMPORTANT TAX RETURN DOCUMENT AVAILABLE." If the correspondence is provided by electronic mail, the foregoing statement must be on the subject line of the electronic mail.If the electronic notice is returned as undeliverable and the correct electronic address cannot be obtained from the payee's records, or from the payee, then the furnisher must furnish the notice by mail, or in person, within 30 days after the electronic notice is returned.The following examples for securing consent are found in Regulation 31.6051-1. These examples apply to any electronically furnished information return. Example one: consent is requested via correspondence.The state sends the recipient a letter, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically on a web site, instead of paper.The letter contains instructions explaining how to consent to receive the form electronically, by accessing the web site, downloading the consent document, completing the consent document, and emailing it back to the state.The consent document posted on the web site uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient reads the instructions and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the statements electronically in the manner described in the regulations. Example two: consent is requested via e-mail.The state sends the recipient an e-mail, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The email contains an attachment, instructing the recipient how to consent to receive the form electronically.The e-mail attachment uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient opens the attachment, reads the instructions, and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations.Example three: consent is requested via a web site posting.The state posts a notice on its web site, stating the recipient may receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The web site contains instructions on how the recipient may access a secure web page and consent to receive the statements electronically By accessing the secure web page and giving consent, the recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations. In each case, the payer took the steps to notify recipients by letter, email or web site posting about the availability of a consent election, prior to issuing returns electronically. Electronic statements are furnished to an individual only after that individual responded with an affirmative consent.If the payee does not consent, a paper document must be sent. As part of the consent process, the government entity must provide a statement with all the following notifications prominently displayed. There are seven notifications.Number one is, if the payee does not consent, a paper copy will be provided. Two, the scope and duration of the consent.Three, how to obtain a paper copy after giving consent.Four, how to withdraw the consent. Five, conditions under which an electronic statement will no longer be furnished.Six, procedures to update payee information. And Seven, a description of hardware and software required to access, print and retain a state-ment, and when it will no longer be available.If the government entity makes any hardware or software changes that create a risk that the recipient won't be able to access the statement, a notice of these changes must be provided to the recipient before changing the hardware or software. The notice must inform the recipient that a new consent to receive the form in the revised electronic format must be provided.After implementing the revised hardware and software changes, the furnisher must obtain a new consent or confirmation of consent from the recipient to receive the form electronically.You can refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6.2, Consent. What do you need to do after you have secured consent? The government entity must place electronically posted Forms 1099-G on the applicable web site by January 31, the due date, and the statement must remain available until at least October 15 of that year.When Forms 1099-G are posted, the issuing entity must notify the consenting payees, either electronically or by mail. For payees who do not provide consent, or who withdraw their consent to receive the Form 1099-G electronically before the statement is furnished, the payer must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline.And again, the deadline would be January 31 for the Form 1099-G. As a payor, you should have a record of the payee consent for every statement you furnish electronically. If you fail to furnish the information in the required manner, this could result in the payee neglecting to report the income on their individual federal, state or local income tax returns. And this could subject them to enforcement actions, including penalties and possibly interest, by multiple government taxing authorities on any taxes that were due and owing. The affirmative consent requirement ensures each payee will either receive the statement on paper or agrees to the electronic delivery.Now here are a few reminders. One, the recipient must not have withdrawn the consent before the statement is furnished. Two, if the recipient subsequently withdraws their consent, your system must notify you and a paper reporting requirement must be resumed. You must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline, and again that is January 31 for Form 1099-Gs. Three, remember, a new consent to receive the statement electronically is required after any new hardware or new software is put into service. And four, all electronic statements must be in a format that conforms to the requirements as stated in Publication 1179.The affirmative consent requirements assure a payee knows the information statement will be furnished electronically, they have the right hardware and software to receive the information statement, and if they don't consent, a paper statement will be provided to them. I’ll share a few common questions we receive about this process and the answers next: The first question is, does the consent to receive the statement electronically have to be provided each tax year, or does it stay in effect until the payee withdraws the consent? The answer is the furnisher can make the determination regarding the scope and duration of the consent if the payee is informed. They can decide whether a consent to receive payee statements electronically lasts for each succeeding tax year, unless it is withdrawn or there is a change in hardware or software requirements, or whether the consent is only effective for the first information return required to be furnished following the date the consent is given. Remember, prior to furnishing the statements electronically, you must provide the recipient a statement with prominently displayed notices, including the scope and duration of the consent.The second question is whether the furnisher has met its obligation to furnish the information return if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically but does not actually retrieve the information return?The answer is they've met their obligation to furnish the info return under Internal Revenue Code Sections 6050B(b) and 6050E(b)if the payee affirmatively consents to receive it electronically. Section 401 of the Job Creation and Workers' Assistance Act of 2002 permits the electronic furnishing of all statements required under Section 6041 through 6050W, if the recipient consents to receive the statement in a manner similar to the one permitted by regulations under Section 6051, or in such other manner as provided by the Secretary.The next question is: Does the furnisher have to obtain affirmative consent to furnish the Form 1099-G electronically? The answer is the furnisher must obtain affirmative consent before they may furnish the Form 1099-G electronically.If a furnisher does not obtain affirmative consent, they must furnish the return by paper, or they will be in violation of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations.The fourth question is: Why should the furnisher comply with the affirmative consent requirement?The affirmative consent requirement assures the payee knows the information return or statement will be furnished electronically and has the right hardware and software to receive the information statement. If the payee does not know the statement is furnished electronically or does not have the right hardware and software to receive it electronically, they may not report income when required. This would result in loss of revenue and increased correspondence and compliance costs. Moreover, and this is not to say that the Internal Revenue Service is considering doing this, the legislative history to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 states, the conferees anticipate the Secretary would seriously consider terminating any exchange of returns or return information under Section 6103 with the state that does not report refunds to the taxpayer. This statement was in the House-Senate Conference Report, HR report number 861, at page 992, dated June 23, 1984.Question five is: What does the phrase 'must furnish a Form 1099-G' mean? The answer is the furnisher must either furnish the payee a paper copy of the Form 1099-G or furnish the Form 1099-G electronically by email or on a secure web site, if it has obtained affirmative consent by the payee.The next question is: Is it acceptable to stop mailing Form 1099-G and furnish the form electronically to the recipients? The answer is the furnisher may furnish the information return electronically if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically. Under current regulations, this means furnishing either by email or on a secure web site.And the last question is: What is a Form 4419 and who needs to file it? The answer is a Form 4419, Application for Filing Information Returns Electronically, is submitted by those payers or agents who file information returns with the IRS electronically. Please review the instructions to Form 4419 for information on how to fill out/submit Form 4419 to the IRS.I hope this has helped clarify the procedures to furnish recipients Form 1099-Gs electronically.These procedures include requesting affirmative consents, receiving and documenting consents, providing required notifications, and furnishing statements to consenting payees electronically" %}.

Standard +Consider Selling Price +Fair Value Uncertainty +Economic Moat +Stewardship Grade +03-11-2022 1 by Greggory Warren +Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022 +While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

The FBI is committed to working with our federal counterparts, our foreign partners, and the private sector to close those gaps. + +These partnerships allow us to defend networks, attribute malicious activity, sanction bad behavior, and take the fight to our adversaries overseas. The FBI fosters this team approach through unique hubs where government, industry, and academia form long-term trusted relationships to combine efforts against cyber threats. + +Within government, that hub is the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF).

If upi, have questions,The TE/GE Office of Federal, State, and Local, Government has oversight for 1099-G filing for government entities. I’ll share how to successfully implement furnishing 1099-Gs electronically, discuss the requirements, and answer questions that many have about the process. Our goal is to provide all the information to help you implement an e-furnishing system for these information returns that complies with the rules and regulations.We all know that our income tax system relies on self-reporting of income, and most Americans depend on receiving and including income reported on various information returns. The likelihood of income being reported properly is greatly improved when information returns are prepared correctly and delivered to payees efficiently.Therefore, the IRS has focused for many years on e-filing and educating payers about e-furnishing to recipients. The Office of Federal State and Local Governments published a web article on this topic, and you can find it by going to IRS.gov and search "requirements for furnishing Form 1099-G electronically". You may want to refer to the article later to review the information provided. It contains many resource links, but the most important one we will be discussing today, which will be mentioned throughout, is Publication 1179, General Rules and Specifications for Substitute Forms 1096, 1098, 1099, 5498, W-2G, and 1042-S.Your best resource for developing a system to electronically furnish information returns is found in Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements on pages 28 and 29 of the publication. As is true with all IRS forms and publications, Publication 1179 can be accessed by going to IRS.gov and selecting 'Forms and Instructions'. You can view forms and publications online, download a PDF, or order hard copies via the Forms and Instructions page.Let's talk about the Form 1099-G, which is an information return that is used by government entities to report certain payments.Government entities are required to file and furnish Form 1099-G if payments were made throughout the year for: unemployment compensation; state or local income tax refunds, credits or offsets; Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance payments; taxable grants; and agricultural payments. You must also file Form 1099-G if you received payments on a commodity credit corporation loan. More details on the types of payments reportable can be found in the instructions for Form 1099-G, also available via IRS.gov.In general, the furnishing requirement is met by providing the recipient or payee with a paper copy of Form 1099-G by January 31 of the year following the year of payment. You must also file a copy of the 1099-G with the IRS before February 28, unless you file electronically, which allows for a due date of March 31st of the same year. The Internal Revenue Code and regulations allow for most information returns to be furnished electronically. +complete: list of allowable return's' ":" found on pages 28 of Pub. 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The 2021 General Instructions for Certain Information Returns specifies who must file information returns, when and where to file them and information about electronic reporting.The instructions also cover correcting and voiding returns, providing statements to recipients, taxpayer identification numbers, backup withholding, penalties and more.With our focus today on furnishing 1099-Gs to recipients electronically what are the incentives to do so?Why migrate to furnishing Form 1099-G electronically to recipients? There are quite a few advantages to it.There may be significant cost benefits that result when paper and printing costs are reduced, mailing processes and fees are reduced if not eliminated, paper handling costs from filing, sorting, storing and shredding are reduced; eliminating re-typing and/or editing of documents reduces costs; and finally, accessibility is a factor. Distribution via secure web access and email is usually most cost-effective and convenient for recipients. How must it be done? In general, organizations will request affirmative consent, receive and document the consent, provide required notifications, and furnish statements to consenting payees electronically.Now let's go into a little more detail on these steps. To use electronic deliveries for information returns to payees, the payer must obtain an affirmative consent from each recipient to whom a statement will be furnished electronically.The consent must be made by the recipient electronically in a way that confirms the recipient can access the statement in the same electronic format in which it will be furnished. For example, if the Form 1099-G will be delivered as a portable document format, or PDF file, then the affirmative consent document format should also be in PDF. In addition, the payer must make certain notifications to each consenting individual. These will be addressed later in the presentation. What does the consent process look like? The first step in the process is to obtain consent from your payees.The procedures that follow were originally included in Revenue Procedure 2004-58 and have been annually updated without material change through and including the current Revenue Procedure 2021-27.You may refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6, Electronic Delivery of Recipient Statements. The process begins with correspondence sent to each individual payee, requesting affirmative consent to electronic delivery of their Form 1099-G. The correspondence may be delivered by mail, electronic mail, in person, or via web site posting, and it must provide instructions on how to affirmatively consent.The correspondence must include the following statement in capital letters: "IMPORTANT TAX RETURN DOCUMENT AVAILABLE." If the correspondence is provided by electronic mail, the foregoing statement must be on the subject line of the electronic mail.If the electronic notice is returned as undeliverable and the correct electronic address cannot be obtained from the payee's records, or from the payee, then the furnisher must furnish the notice by mail, or in person, within 30 days after the electronic notice is returned.The following examples for securing consent are found in Regulation 31.6051-1. These examples apply to any electronically furnished information return. Example one: consent is requested via correspondence.The state sends the recipient a letter, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically on a web site, instead of paper.The letter contains instructions explaining how to consent to receive the form electronically, by accessing the web site, downloading the consent document, completing the consent document, and emailing it back to the state.The consent document posted on the web site uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient reads the instructions and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the statements electronically in the manner described in the regulations. Example two: consent is requested via e-mail.The state sends the recipient an e-mail, stating the recipient may consent to receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The email contains an attachment, instructing the recipient how to consent to receive the form electronically.The e-mail attachment uses the same electronic format that the state will use for the electronically furnished form. The recipient opens the attachment, reads the instructions, and submits the consent in the manner provided in the instructions. The recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations.Example three: consent is requested via a web site posting.The state posts a notice on its web site, stating the recipient may receive the form electronically instead of paper format. The web site contains instructions on how the recipient may access a secure web page and consent to receive the statements electronically By accessing the secure web page and giving consent, the recipient has consented to receive the form electronically in the manner described in the regulations. In each case, the payer took the steps to notify recipients by letter, email or web site posting about the availability of a consent election, prior to issuing returns electronically. Electronic statements are furnished to an individual only after that individual responded with an affirmative consent.If the payee does not consent, a paper document must be sent. As part of the consent process, the government entity must provide a statement with all the following notifications prominently displayed. There are seven notifications.Number one is, if the payee does not consent, a paper copy will be provided. Two, the scope and duration of the consent.Three, how to obtain a paper copy after giving consent.Four, how to withdraw the consent. Five, conditions under which an electronic statement will no longer be furnished.Six, procedures to update payee information. And Seven, a description of hardware and software required to access, print and retain a state-ment, and when it will no longer be available.If the government entity makes any hardware or software changes that create a risk that the recipient won't be able to access the statement, a notice of these changes must be provided to the recipient before changing the hardware or software. The notice must inform the recipient that a new consent to receive the form in the revised electronic format must be provided.After implementing the revised hardware and software changes, the furnisher must obtain a new consent or confirmation of consent from the recipient to receive the form electronically.You can refer to the affirmative consent procedures on pages 28 and 29 of Publication 1179, under Section 4.6.2, Consent. What do you need to do after you have secured consent? The government entity must place electronically posted Forms 1099-G on the applicable web site by January 31, the due date, and the statement must remain available until at least October 15 of that year.When Forms 1099-G are posted, the issuing entity must notify the consenting payees, either electronically or by mail. For payees who do not provide consent, or who withdraw their consent to receive the Form 1099-G electronically before the statement is furnished, the payer must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline.And again, the deadline would be January 31 for the Form 1099-G. As a payor, you should have a record of the payee consent for every statement you furnish electronically. If you fail to furnish the information in the required manner, this could result in the payee neglecting to report the income on their individual federal, state or local income tax returns. And this could subject them to enforcement actions, including penalties and possibly interest, by multiple government taxing authorities on any taxes that were due and owing. The affirmative consent requirement ensures each payee will either receive the statement on paper or agrees to the electronic delivery.Now here are a few reminders. One, the recipient must not have withdrawn the consent before the statement is furnished. Two, if the recipient subsequently withdraws their consent, your system must notify you and a paper reporting requirement must be resumed. You must provide a paper payee statement within the regular deadline, and again that is January 31 for Form 1099-Gs. Three, remember, a new consent to receive the statement electronically is required after any new hardware or new software is put into service. And four, all electronic statements must be in a format that conforms to the requirements as stated in Publication 1179.The affirmative consent requirements assure a payee knows the information statement will be furnished electronically, they have the right hardware and software to receive the information statement, and if they don't consent, a paper statement will be provided to them. I’ll share a few common questions we receive about this process and the answers next: The first question is, does the consent to receive the statement electronically have to be provided each tax year, or does it stay in effect until the payee withdraws the consent? The answer is the furnisher can make the determination regarding the scope and duration of the consent if the payee is informed. They can decide whether a consent to receive payee statements electronically lasts for each succeeding tax year, unless it is withdrawn or there is a change in hardware or software requirements, or whether the consent is only effective for the first information return required to be furnished following the date the consent is given. Remember, prior to furnishing the statements electronically, you must provide the recipient a statement with prominently displayed notices, including the scope and duration of the consent.The second question is whether the furnisher has met its obligation to furnish the information return if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically but does not actually retrieve the information return?The answer is they've met their obligation to furnish the info return under Internal Revenue Code Sections 6050B(b) and 6050E(b)if the payee affirmatively consents to receive it electronically. Section 401 of the Job Creation and Workers' Assistance Act of 2002 permits the electronic furnishing of all statements required under Section 6041 through 6050W, if the recipient consents to receive the statement in a manner similar to the one permitted by regulations under Section 6051, or in such other manner as provided by the Secretary.The next question is: Does the furnisher have to obtain affirmative consent to furnish the Form 1099-G electronically? The answer is the furnisher must obtain affirmative consent before they may furnish the Form 1099-G electronically.If a furnisher does not obtain affirmative consent, they must furnish the return by paper, or they will be in violation of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations.The fourth question is: Why should the furnisher comply with the affirmative consent requirement?The affirmative consent requirement assures the payee knows the information return or statement will be furnished electronically and has the right hardware and software to receive the information statement. If the payee does not know the statement is furnished electronically or does not have the right hardware and software to receive it electronically, they may not report income when required. This would result in loss of revenue and increased correspondence and compliance costs. Moreover, and this is not to say that the Internal Revenue Service is considering doing this, the legislative history to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 states, the conferees anticipate the Secretary would seriously consider terminating any exchange of returns or return information under Section 6103 with the state that does not report refunds to the taxpayer. This statement was in the House-Senate Conference Report, HR report number 861, at page 992, dated June 23, 1984.Question five is: What does the phrase 'must furnish a Form 1099-G' mean? The answer is the furnisher must either furnish the payee a paper copy of the Form 1099-G or furnish the Form 1099-G electronically by email or on a secure web site, if it has obtained affirmative consent by the payee.The next question is: Is it acceptable to stop mailing Form 1099-G and furnish the form electronically to the recipients? The answer is the furnisher may furnish the information return electronically if the payee has affirmatively consented to receive the information return electronically. Under current regulations, this means furnishing either by email or on a secure web site.And the last question is: What is a Form 4419 and who needs to file it? The answer is a Form 4419, Application for Filing Information Returns Electronically, is submitted by those payers or agents who file information returns with the IRS electronically. Please review the instructions to Form 4419 for information on how to fill out/submit Form 4419 to the IRS.I hope this has helped clarify the procedures to furnish recipients Form 1099-Gs electronically.These procedures include requesting affirmative consents, receiving and documenting consents, providing required notifications, and furnishing statements to consenting payees electronically" %}.

# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en) :sparkles:. 

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon <img src="./assets/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository](/contributing/working-in-docs-repository.md) :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

Check to see what [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. 

 <img src="./assets/images/contribution_cta.png" width="300" height="150" /> 

#### Make changes in a codespace

For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a codespace](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md)."

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Install or update to **Node.js v16**. For more information, see [the development guide](contributing/development.md).

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The GitHub team thanks you :sparkles:. 

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). 

Now that you are part of the GitHub docs community, see how else you can [contribute to the docs](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md).

## Windows

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix-based systems use `\n`. Therefore, when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
2. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
3. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
4. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with `msys`. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
    - Update Git configuration: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
    - Consider using a different Git client on Windows

# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en) :sparkles:. 

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon <img src="./assets/images/table-of-contents.png" width="25" height="25" /> on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository](/contributing/working-in-docs-repository.md) :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

Check to see what [types of contributions](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md) we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. 

 <img src="./assets/images/contribution_cta.png" width="300" height="150" /> 

#### Make changes in a codespace

For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a codespace](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md)."

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Install or update to **Node.js v16**. For more information, see [the development guide](contributing/development.md).

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The GitHub team thanks you :sparkles:. 

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). 

Now that you are part of the GitHub docs community, see how else you can [contribute to the docs](/contributing/types-of-contributions.md).

## Windows

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

1. Regular Expressions: Windows uses `\r\n` for line endings, while Unix-based systems use `\n`. Therefore, when working on Regular Expressions, use `\r?\n` instead of `\n` in order to support both environments. The Node.js [`os.EOL`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol) property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
2. Paths: Windows systems use `\` for the path separator, which would be returned by `path.join` and others. You could use `path.posix`, `path.posix.join` etc and the [slash](https://ghub.io/slash) module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
3. Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write [scripts](/script) in JavaScript instead of Bash.
4. Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with `msys`. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
    - Update Git configuration: `git config --system core.longpaths true`
    - Consider using a different Git client on Windows

For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running steps or jobs conditionally
GitHub Actions supports conditions on steps and jobs using data present in your workflow context.

For example, to run a step only as part of a push and not in a pull_request, you can specify a condition in the if: property based on the event name:

steps:
- run: npm publish
  if: github.event_name == 'push'
