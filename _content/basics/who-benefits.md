Open source software benefits programmers and non-programmers alike. In fact, because much of the Internet itself is built on many open source technologies—like [the Linux operating system](/resources/what-is-linux) and the [Apache Web server application](http://httpd.apache.org/)—anyone using the Internet benefits from open source software. Every time computer users view webpages, check email, chat with friends, stream music online, or play multiplayer video games, their computers, mobile phones, or gaming consoles connect to a global network of computers that routes and transmits their data to the "local" devices they have in front of them.

The computers that do all this important work are typically located in faraway places that users don't see or can't physically access—which is why some people call these computers "remote computers." More and more, people rely on remote computers when doing things they might otherwise do on their local devices. For example, they use online word processing, email management, and image editing software that they don't install and run on their personal computers. Instead, they simply access these programs on remote computers by using a Web browser or mobile phone application.

Some people call remote computing "cloud computing," because it involves activities (like storing files, sharing photos, or watching videos) that incorporate not only local devices, but also the global network of remote computers that form an "atmosphere" around them. Cloud computing is an increasingly important aspect of everyday life with Internet-connected devices. Some cloud computing applications, like Google Docs, are closed source programs. Others, like [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/), are open source programs.

Cloud computing applications run "on top" of additional software that helps them operate smoothly and effectively. The software that runs "underneath" cloud computing applications acts as a [_platform_](/life/14/4/why-open-infrastructure-matters) for those applications. Cloud computing platforms can be open source or closed source. [OpenStack](/resources/what-is-openstack) is an example of an open source cloud computing platform.
