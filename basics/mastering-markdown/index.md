## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. Bold, italics, font size, images, and lists are just a few of the things we can do with it.

** [Here’s an example from the GitHub API developer documentation](https://github.com/github/developer.github.com). **

## A little bit about the format

Imagine you have a document with several paragraphs. You think, “This would look best if I could do some formatting such as a header for a paragraph, like I would in a traditional word processor.”

To practice this, [create a new practice issue](https://github.com/githubtraining/sample-markdown/issues/new) and type a bit of text in the comment section with a "#" in front to denote your header. You have now created the first heading of your document.

## Basic use in a file

The most common locations that we see Markdown used is in Issues, as discussed above, and in README.md files.

<a id="gfm" title="Issues, Gists, Pull Requests, Comments" class="toc-item"></a>
## Basic use everywhere (Issues, Gists, Pull Requests)

## Special Flavors

Often basic Markdown flavored text can benefit from formatting beyond basic font sizes, bolding, and italicizing. With GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can quickly create rich content like Task Lists, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and sentiments through emoji. Documents retain clean and simple text content but have rich rendered views.

* TaskList
* Strikethrough
* Emoji
* Code fences ```
* Syntax highlighting for code blocks with language definition
* SHA references
* Issues references in same repo
* Username @mentions
* Cross-repo mentions with username/repo#Issue
* URL auto-linking
* Relative image linking within repository
