_Open source_ and _free software_ both refer to software whose source code is available for anyone to modify or use for any purpose, but they have different motivations.

The term ‘free software’ pre-dates open source software, and focuses on several [kinds of freedom](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) that are associated with the software, thereby taking a more ethical viewpoint on the matter.

_Free software_ is an expression used by the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/). For some, it is the preferable term and they do not wish to associate themselves with the term open source. Free software must not be confused with ‘freeware’, which is software that can be acquired at no cost but for which source code may well not be available.

Many use "open source" and "free software" interchangably. A common abbreviation for this collection of software is _FOSS_, meaning "Free and Open Source Software".
