Open source describes a group of licences that all meet a certain set of conditions. The conditions are maintained by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org), and the conditions are referred to as the Open Source Definition (OSD). We will briefly review them here.

An open source licence must:

- grant the licensee the right to distribute the program themselves, including the right to charge money for it
- grant access to the programâ€™s source code
- grant the right to modify the program
- grant the right to distribute modified versions of the program
- allow use of the program by all persons or groups in all fields of endeavour
- apply to everyone who receives the program, without the need for any additional agreements
- apply to the program it licenses, whether the program is obtained as part of a group of programs, or on its own
- allow distribution with any other software
- allow distribution in any form

The desired effect of these conditions is to promote wide distribution of software, and to encourage people who receive the software to contribute to its functionality by modifying the source code. Although it may seem that granting these rights might lead to a large number of slightly variant versions of a piece of software, in practice successful open source software projects tend to absorb disparate modifications made by many contributors back into a single modified and improved version.

It is worth noting the second part of the first bulleted point above. It is a common misconception that one cannot charge money for distributing open source software. This is not the case. In practice, it is rarely done, mainly because each one of your customers could give away the software in direct competition to your own sales.
