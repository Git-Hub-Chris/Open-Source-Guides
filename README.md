# GitHub Guides

## Definitions ("What Goes Where")

**training.github.com/kit:** "I'm a trainer or teacher wanting to have full length lessons."

**help.github.com:** "Help, I'm screwed!" solutions via data and information.

**guides.github.com:** "I wish I knew how to..." solutions via long form tutorials and walk-throughs. These are conceptual and procedural documents telling a story and not necessarily an individual feature.

Conceptual + Procedural: What is this => Okay here's how we do it

- Guides have more of a product focus. What the core pieces of the product are, and are the bigger product pieces we want people to do.

- If we had to sit down and explain GitHub and important interactions to have on it, everything we list in those 30 seconds should be a guide.

### Examples
An Organizations guide would maybe show setting up billings, security around orgs with 2fa, setting up teams, etc.

Porter on it's own wouldn't fit as a guide because it's a short form procedural document showing its individual features. The story it could be in is "Getting your project on GitHub" where one way we can get a project on github is through importing
