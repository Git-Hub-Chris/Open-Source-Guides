The default language for most open source projects is English. If English is not your native language, you could make a valuable contribution by translating the project applications and documentation into your own language. Even if you can spare only an hour here or there, your translation work will make a difference.

Find out how to contribute by joining the appropriate mailing list. Some of the bigger projects have a separate team for each language represented on the project. If your language is not yet represented, you could even start your own language team.
