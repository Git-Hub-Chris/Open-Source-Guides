# GitHub Guides

[GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) are highly approachable tutorials about a larger idea or product feature on GitHub. They not only explain how to accomplish a task, but also why youâ€™d want to, and how that task fits into the larger story of using GitHub as a whole.

## What are the components that form a guide?

For a deep-dive into the way a guide should be authored, take a look at the [GitHub Guides Content Model](https://manual-of-style.githubapp.com/guides-model) (another [GitHub Content Model](https://manual-of-style.githubapp.com/content-model) Joint).

## Other forms of user assistance

**training.github.com/kit:** Materials for individuals who want to deliver full-length lessons about Git or GitHub.

**help.github.com:** Discrete articles that get existing users unstuck and back to work (yes, Virginia - [there's a content model for that](https://manual-of-style.githubapp.com/help-model), too!).
