This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting opensource@github.com, which is a shared team inbox. If the incident involves someone who receives that shared inbox, you can contact an individual maintainer (@bkeepers or @nayafia) at ```GitHub username``` + ```@github.com```. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
