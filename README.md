# GitHub Guides

Long form tutorials
help: data and information
guides: learning, not a list of help docs, not just explaining a feature, or showing something off. If you want to walk someone through a process, thats a guide. Walk-throughs
training: i'm a teacher wanting to teach this stuff
GitHub Guides is the place to come to learn about the GitHub Universeâ„¢. Think of it as a collection of tutorials, tips, and workflows to help people learn GitHub and become experts. If you've got an idea for a tutorial, write it up! **We're always looking for more tutorials**.
