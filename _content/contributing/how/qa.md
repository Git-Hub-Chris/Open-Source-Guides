Quality assurance (QA) is one of the most important elements of any project. It is also something to which almost anyone can contribute.

As a user, you can help by testing [release candidates](releasemanagement) before they are formally released and reporting any bugs on the issue tracker. You can also run the latest version of the software and report any bugs. Developers can contribute by fixing those bugs, and by helping to manage them until they are fixed.

To encourage ongoing contributions, it is vital that the project team keeps users and contributors informed of activity on issues in the issue tracker. For example, they should examine each new issue and comment on it, marking duplicates and highlighting workarounds. They should also discuss potential solutions and close them when work is complete.
