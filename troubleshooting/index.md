This section of the handbook addresses some common situations or questions that may come up as you maintain your open source project.

These topics aren't fun. They may feel unfamiliar or force you out of your comfort zone. No matter what you do, people may feel upset or criticize how you handled the situation.

Sometimes, being a maintainer is a thankless job. If you're reading this section, though, you've taken an important first step towards becoming a leader, and for that, we thank you. ❤️

## Troubleshooting topics

* [Enforcing your code of conduct](conduct/)
* [Feeling guilty or burned out](burnout/)
* [Finding community consensus](finding-consensus/)
* [Handling contributions you don't want to accept](contributions/)
* [Getting paid for open source work](getting-paid/)
