From the very start of your project's public existence, you
should maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward rude or insulting
behavior in its forums.  Zero-tolerance does not mean technical
enforcement per se.  You don't have to remove people from the mailing
list when they flame another subscriber, or take away their commit
access because they made derogatory comments.  (In theory, you might
eventually have to resort to such actions, but only after all other
avenues have failed—which, by definition, isn't the case at the
start of the project.)  Zero-tolerance simply means never letting bad
behavior slide by unnoticed.  For example, when someone posts a
technical comment mixed together with an ad
hominem attack on some other developer in the project,
it is imperative that your response address the ad
hominem attack as a separate issue unto itself,
separate from the technical content.

It is unfortunately very easy, and all too typical, for
constructive discussions to lapse into destructive flame wars.
People will say things in email that they would never say
face-to-face.  The topics of discussion only amplify this effect: in
technical issues, people often feel there is a single right answer to
most questions, and that disagreement with that answer can only be
explained by ignorance or stupidity.  It's a short distance from
calling someone's technical proposal stupid to calling the person
themselves stupid.  In fact, it's often hard to tell where technical
debate leaves off and character attack begins, which is one reason why
drastic responses or punishments are not a good idea.  Instead, when
you think you see it happening, make a post that stresses the
importance of keeping the discussion friendly, without accusing anyone
of being deliberately poisonous.  Such "Nice Police" posts do have an
unfortunate tendency to sound like a kindergarten teacher lecturing a
class on good behavior:

> First, let's please cut down on the (potentially) ad hominem comments; for example, calling J's design for the security layer "naive and ignorant of the basic principles of computer security." That may be true or it may not, but in either case it's no way to have the discussion. J made his proposal in good faith. If it has deficiencies, point them out, and we'll fix them or get a new design. I'm sure M meant no personal insult to J, but the phrasing was unfortunate, and we try to keep things constructive around here.
>
> Now, on to the proposal. I think M was right in saying that...

As stilted as such responses sound, they have a noticeable
effect.  If you consistently call out bad behavior, but don't demand
an apology or acknowledgment from the offending party, then you leave
people free to cool down and show their better side by behaving more
decorously next time—and they will.

One of the secrets of
doing this successfully is to never make the meta-discussion the main
topic.  It should always be an aside, a brief preface to the main
portion of your response.  Point out in passing that "we don't do
things that way around here," but then move on to the real content, so
that you're giving people something on-topic to respond to.  If
someone protests that they didn't deserve your rebuke, simply refuse
to be drawn into an argument about it.  Either don't respond (if you
think they're just letting off steam and don't require a response), or
say you're sorry if you overreacted and that it's hard to detect
nuance in email, then get back to the main topic.  Never, ever insist
on an acknowledgment, whether public or private, from someone that
they behaved inappropriately.  If they choose of their own volition to
post an apology, that's great, but demanding that they do so will only
cause resentment.

The overall goal is to make good etiquette be seen as one of the
"in-group" behaviors.  This helps the project, because developers can
be driven away (even from projects they like and want to support) by
flame wars.  You may not even know that they were driven away; someone
might lurk on the mailing list, see that it takes a thick skin to
participate in the project, and decide against getting involved at
all.  Keeping forums friendly is a long-term survival strategy, and
it's easier to do when the project is still small.  Once it's part of
the culture, you won't have to be the only person promoting it.  It
will be maintained by everyone.
