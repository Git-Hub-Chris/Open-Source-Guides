For an open development project, money is less important than active contribution. However, some people or organisations are cash rich and time poor, and would prefer to make their contribution in the form of cash. If you want to make a significant donation, you may be able to sponsor a developer to implement a new feature or fix some bugs.

The project website should provide clear guidance on how to go about making a donation. It should also ensure that there is a secure and easy-to-use mechanism for accepting donations that will allow various categories of sponsors to express their appreciation for the project as a whole.
