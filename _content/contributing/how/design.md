If you have graphics or art skills, you can make a valuable contribution by creating icons, logos, wallpapers, banners, labels and other artwork. These will be seen every day and could potentially be used throughout the project and across all its products. You could also participate by designing websites, designing marketing material or providing illustrations for presentations and guides.

You would normally submit this kind of contribution via the relevant mailing list or issue tracker once you have engaged with a project and developed a feel for it.
