We'll start with the basics. What is open source? What do I need to know before launching a project? What should my project include?

The Open Source Handbook is meant to help you launch projects of all shapes and sizes. While we cover strategies that are relevant to every project, you may find certain sections more or less useful, depending on what you need.

One more thing: we can give you advice on running an open source project, but we're not lawyers. Be sure to read our [disclaimer](../disclaimer) before you dive in.

### You're open sourcing a project for the first time
You've heard a lot about this "open source" thing and you'd like to release a project for the first time.

If you're worried about getting things right, check out ["Preparing for launch"](../preparing) for a quickstart guide, as well as the [Marketing](../../marketing/index) section.

### You've open sourced projects before, but you'd like to sharpen your skills
You currently maintain a few open source projects. You understand the basic mechanics, but there are some things you think you could do better.

If you're hoping to improve your skills as a maintainer, take a look at the [Sustaining Growth](../../sustaining/index) and [Troubleshooting](../../troubleshooting/index) sections.

### You're trying to build a large community project
For you, the best part about open source is *collaboration*. You're excited to work on a project with people from all over the world.

If community is important to you, keep an eye out for resources such as ["Building a community"](../../marketing/building-community) and ["Sustaining healthy communities"](../../sustaining/healthy-communities).

### You're a company open sourcing a project
Your company is about to open source a previously internal project. You want to do it without breaking any laws or upsetting anyone who will interact with your project.

If you're worried about making lawyers happy, ["The legal side of open source"](../legal) and ["Leadership & governance"](../../sustaining/leadership) can help you with trademark, license, and other company matters.
