With more and more people joining GitHub and adding projects every day, keeping up with all of them can be difficult. However, this can be fun and easy by following users or watching repositories, simply showing interest in them by starring, or using explore to find new people and projects.

### Follow A Friend

One of the great features on GitHub is the ability to see what other people are working on and who they are connecting with. 
When you follow someone, you'll get notifications on your dashboard about their GitHub activity.

#### Step 1: Pick a friend.

Why not follow one of these cool people from GitHub (including their pet tanuki!):

#### Step 2: Follow that friend (in a non-creepy way)

Once you are on one of their pages, click the "follow" button.

Congratulations! You are now following a friend.

### Watch A Project

At some point you may want to stay up-to-date with a specific project. We've made this easy to do.

#### Watch a project

Our friend the Octocat has a project called [Hello World] [1] that we'd like to watch.

Once you are on the project page, you will notice there is a "watch" button at the top of the page. Click on it.

Congratulations! You are now watching the Hello World project. If the Octocat updates it, you will see what happened in your dashboard.


### More Things You Can Do

You've done some of the most basic social interaction GitHub has to offer, but don't stop there! Check out these other social features:

#### Pull Requests

![Pull Request Button](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/repository/repo-actions-pullrequest.png)

You may find yourself wanting to contribute to someone else's project, whether to add features or to fix bugs. After making changes, you can let the original author know about them by sending a [pull request][2].

#### Issues

![Issues Button](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/repository/repo-tabs-issues.png)

When you are collaborating on a project with someone, you sometimes come across problems that need to be fixed. To help you keep track of these problems, each GitHub repository has a section called Issues. For an example, check out the [issues] [3] for the Spoon-Knife repository.

#### Organizations

![Switch account context dropdown](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/overview/dashboard-contextswitcher.png)

Have you found yourself wishing you could collaborate with multiple developers on one project? You can manage everyone with Organizations! With an organization you can establish teams with special permissions, have a public organization profile, and keep track of activity within the organization.

### Celebrate

Congratulations! You are quite the socialite.
