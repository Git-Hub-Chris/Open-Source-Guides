# Guide for Guides
Welcome to the Guide for Guides!

## How do I help?

- File an issue with a proposal for the new Guide.
  - Attach the label of `guide-suggestion`.
- Make sure to cc a domain expert if you aren't one.
- If you want to write the guide yourself and the proposal has been agreed upon, create a branch, write the guide, and /cc the @github/guides team.

Just because you wrote the proposal doesn't mean you have to write the guide. It's up to you!

If there's a Guide currently being written you want to help out with, don't be a stranger! Comment on the issue to provide feedback or see if the contributor would love your help.

## How should I go about writing a Guide?

- Write the steps, then include the screenshot corresponding to those words when writing a Guide.

If you or a domain expert thinks the Guide is a good idea, just start writing. We can iron out small details of format later (I sometimes find an outline in the initial issue gets me going).

If there isn't a category folder for your file yet, don't fret! Either create a category you think makes sense, or ask for help creating one in the pull request.

### Images
Images should be put in the same directory that you're writing your Guide in:

```
![GitHubâ€™s API Developer Site README](features/masteringmarkdown/github-developer-api-readme.jpg)
```
This way we can render them with Markdown AND they're easier to keep track of for updating. Since `masteringmarkdown-github-developer-api-readme.jpg` lives in the same directory as the Markdown file referencing it, we can just call the file by name in the parenthesis part of the image Markdown.

## Determining your Guide's order

Open up the *_config.yml* file in the root of the *guides* folder, and you'll see some code that looks like this:

```yml
organization:
  - /introduction/flow/index.html
  - /introduction/desktop/index.html
  - /activities/contributing-to-open-source/index.html
  - /activities/forking/index.html
  - /activities/socialize/index.html
  - /features/issues/index.html
  - /features/mastering-markdown/index.html
```

Those paths determine how the landing page for Guides is ordered. (Jekyll gleefully fetches whatever it can, so sometimes the front page gets reshuffled when the site is built.)

Add a path to your new Guide wherever you see fit!
