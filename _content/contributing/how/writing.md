Documentation is critical to new users and something that developers don’t always have time to write or update. One of the best ways in which you, as an existing user, can contribute is by documenting your own experiences of the project. This could be in the form of tutorials, guides, HOW TOs or FAQs (frequently asked questions). These don’t have to be perfect: in most cases, a skeleton document with bullet-point instructions is better than nothing at all. Those who use the document will probably ask supplementary questions and, once they understand, can help to pad out the details. Most communities are willing to help documentation authors by confirming information, answering questions or providing more detail.

Many open source projects maintain a separate community wiki for editing and writing documentation. Rather than answer the same question twice, you could write up the answer and make it available to everyone on the wiki. You could also contribute to the wiki whenever you see something that could be improved or updated, or report an error as a bug. It is helpful to make people aware of any changes you have made by mentioning them on the mailing list.

## User FAQs

User FAQs are an excellent place to start contributing to a project. If you’re not technical, you can simply post a note in the issue tracker with a proposed FAQ entry.

## HOW-TOs and tutorials

These short, self-contained documents are also a great place to start for both users and contributors. If you are well-versed in a particular feature of a project, documenting it for others would be an extremely welcome contribution. Equally, if you have come across a problem with the software or any other aspect of the project, you could write about it and document a solution, which will be very useful to other users. Providing video screencasts, which can be very effective for introductions and HOW-TOs, would also be a good way to contribute.

## User guide

Writing and maintaining a comprehensive user guide for the project is a difficult job requiring a lot of time and effort. Any additions, clarifications and corrections to the user guide from users would therefore be very much appreciated by the project team. To do this, users can draw on the user mailing list archives or forums, which will probably contain a lot of material that can be easily converted into paragraphs. Again, the community will usually be happy to help documentation writers.

## Developer guide

If the project has a developer guide, the team will almost certainly welcome improvements or new content, but you will need some technical skills to contribute to this kind of documentation. If you have this kind of expertise, it’s a great place to start gaining an understanding of how to develop with or for the project. The developer mailing list archives and forums will contain plenty of useful information, and the developers themselves are usually happy to help documentation authors.
