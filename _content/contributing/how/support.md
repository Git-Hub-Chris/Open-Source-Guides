Once you have gained some experience of the project, you can support new users who have no experience. Helping people to get started is critical to the medium- to long-term success of the project. This is because some of these newcomers will themselves become contributors and ensure the ongoing development and support of the project.

The quickest, easiest and most significant way to provide such support in the early stages of your involvement is to answer newcomersâ€™ questions. These are often best answered by those who have themselves recently experienced the same issues. By answering questions from newcomers, you will also be helping the project by saving the developers time.

As you gain experience, you will be able to ask and subsequently answer more complex questions. In turn, you will be supported by more experienced users as the complexity of your own requests grows. In this way, providing support will benefit both you and the project itself.
