<a id="intro" title="Intro" class="toc-item"></a>

[Digital Object Identifiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) (DOI) are the backbone of the academic reference and metrics system.

In this tutorial we're going to learn how to archive one of your GitHub repositories and assign it a DOI using the data archiving tool [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).

> **Tip:** Note, this tutorial is aimed at researchers who want to cite GitHub repositories in the academic literature. Most people don't need to do this but if you do then read on...

_Should explain what Zenodo is here?_

#### Install & Code Free Zone

Provided you've already got a GitHub repository set up that you want to archive then this tutorial can be completed without installing any special software. If you haven't got your project on GitHub yet then check out this guide that explains how to [upload your work](https://guides.github.com/introduction/desktop/) to GitHub.

## Choosing Your Repository

Repositories are the basic unit of GitHub. We first need to select the repository we want to archive in Zenodo. Head over to your profile and click the 'repositories' tab.

> **Important!** Make sure you tell people how they can reuse your work by including a license in your repository. If you don't know which license is right for you then take a look at [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/)
