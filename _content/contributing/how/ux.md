Project teams are always keen to know more about how users engage with the project and how they would like it to look and function. This feedback is vital to the life of the project. Without it, the team would not be able to improve the softwareâ€™s usability, a key element that could make the project stand out among its competitors.

As a new user, you may feel reluctant to make requests or provide criticism, no matter how constructive, for fear of seeming impolite or ungrateful. But most open source projects will encourage you in every possible way to contribute to discussions on user mailing lists or add feature requests to the issue tracker. At the same time, they will probably make you aware that not all feature requests will be implemented, although every comment will be carefully considered and feedback will be provided as to how important that request is.
