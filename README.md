# GitHub Guides

## Definitions ("What Goes Where")

**training.github.com/kit:** "I'm a trainer or teacher wanting to have full length lessons."

**help.github.com:** "Help, I'm screwed!" solutions via data and information. These are short instructions to perform a discrete task

**guides.github.com:** "I wish I knew how to..." solutions via long form tutorials and walk-throughs. These are conceptual and procedural documents telling a story and are not necessarily an individual feature.

Conceptual + Procedural: What is this => Okay here's how we do it

- Guides have more of a product focus. They communicate what the core pieces of the product are and how to use them. Guides should cover the fundamentally important interactions and workflows people have and use on GitHub.

### Examples

- **Good candidate for a Guide**: A Guide to Organizations that walks a user through *why* an organization is useful and how to create one, set up teams and permissions, change billing settings.
- **Good candidate for a Help article**: Porter is a new and important feature within the product. However, it makes more sense to write a Help article than a Guide about Porter because all we need is a short-form procedural document. If we wanted to include information about Porter in a Guide, we could add it to "Getting your project on GitHub", since that Guide tells a larger story about moving code to GitHub.
