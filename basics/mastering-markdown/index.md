# Mastering Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight and easy to use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

**What you will learn:**
* How the Markdown format makes styled collaborative editing easy
* How Markdown differs from traditional formatting approaches
* How to use Markdown to format text
* How to leverage GitHub’s automatic Markdown rendering
* How to apply GitHub’s unique Markdown extensions

## What is Markdown?
Since writing is a critical form of collaboration, you will want it to be as rich as possible. As you start writing in Issues (bug tickets), Pull Requests (code reviews and discussions) and Gists (short single-file documents), you’ll quickly desire some formatting capabilities.  But formatting, to most people means a series of buttons on toolbars with Bold, Italics, Underline, and Hyperlink.  Those buttons often create invisible codes in the document behind your editor that make the document heavier to transmit, more complicated to compare to another version, and challenging to merge in changes from your collaborators.

[Markdown, which has been around since 2004](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) offers an easy but rich way to format. Here’s an [example from the GitHub API developer documentation](https://github.com/github/developer.github.com).

## A little bit about the format
> (How much of this should be in the Help article and how much should be in the guide? https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
> (What should we have them using for following along? Gist? Issues? README.md?)

Imagine you have a document with several paragraphs. You think, “This would look best if I could do some formatting such as a header for a paragraph, like I would in a traditional word processor.” To practice this, [create a new practice issue](https://github.com/githubtraining/sample-markdown/issues/new), type a bit of text, type a “#” in front of the text line containing your header. You have now created the first heading of your document.

## Basic use in a file
The most common locations that we see Markdown used is in Issues, as discussed above, and in README.md files.

## Basic use everywhere (Issues, Gists, Pull Requests)

## Special Flavors

Often basic Markdown flavored text can benefit from formatting beyond basic font sizes, bolding, and italicizing. With GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can quickly create rich content like Task Lists, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and sentiments through emoji. Documents retain clean and simple text content but have rich rendered views.

* TaskList
* Strikethrough
* Emoji
* Code fences ```
* Syntax highlighting for code blocks with language definition
* SHA references
* Issues references in same repo
* Username @mentions
* Cross-repo mentions with username/repo#Issue
* URL auto-linking
* Relative image linking within repository
