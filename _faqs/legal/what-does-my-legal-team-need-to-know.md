title: What does my company's legal team need to know?
---

First, they should know that you're open sourcing a project.

For better or worse, consider letting them know even if it's a personal project. You probably have an "employee IP agreement" with your company that gives them some control of your projects, especially if they are at all related to the company's business or you use any company resources to develop the project. Your company _should_ easily give you permission, and maybe already has through an employee-friendly IP agreement or a company policy. If not, you can negotiate (for example, explain that your project serves the company' professional learning and development objectives for you), or avoid working on your project until you find a better company.

If you're open sourcing a project for your company, then definitely let them know. Your legal team probably already has policies for what open source license (and maybe additional contributor agreement) to use based on the company's business requirements and expertise around ensuring your project complies with the licenses of its dependencies. If not, you and they are in luck! Your legal team should be eager to work with you to figure this stuff out. Some things to think about:

* **Third party material:** Does your project have dependencies created by others or otherwise include or use others' code? If these are open source, you'll need to comply with the materials' open source licenses. That starts with choosing a license that works with the third party open source licenses (see above). If your project modifies or distributes third party open source material, then your legal team will also want to know that you're meeting other conditions of the third party open source licenses such as retaining copyright notices. If your project uses others' code that does't have an open source license, you'll probably have to ask the third party maintainers to [add an open source license](http://choosealicense.com/no-license/#for-users), and if you can't get one, stop using their code in your project.
* **Trade secrets:** Consider whether there is anything in the project that the company does not want to make available to the general public. If so, you could open source the rest of your project, after extracting the material the you want to keep private.
* **Patents:** Is your company applying for a patent of which open sourcing your project would constitute [public disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_disclosure)? Sadly, you might be asked to wait (or maybe the company will reconsider the wisdom of the application). If you're expecting contributions to your project from employees of companies with large patent portfolios, your legal team may want you to use a license with an express patent grant from contributors (such as Apache 2.0 or GPLv3), or an additional contributor agreement (see above).
* **Trademarks:** Double check that your project's name [does not conflict with any existing trademarks](../branding/#avoiding-name-conflicts). If you use your own company trademarks in the project, check that it does not cause any conflicts.
* **Privacy:** Does your project collect data on users? "Phone home" to company servers? Your legal team can help you comply with company policies and external regulations.

If you're releasing your company's first open source project, the above is more than enough to get through (but don't worry, most projects shouldn't raise any major concerns).

Longer term your legal team can do more to help the company get more from its involvement in open source, and stay safe:

* **Employee contribution policies:** Consider developing a corporate policy that specifies how your employees contribute to open source projects. A clear policy will reduce confusion among your employees and help them contribute to open source projects in the company's best interest, whether as part of their jobs or in their free time. A good example is Rackspace's [Model IP and Open Source Contribution Policy](https://processmechanics.com/2015/07/23/a-model-ip-and-open-source-contribution-policy/).
* **What to release:** [(Almost) everything?](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html) If your legal team understands and is invested in your company's open source strategy, they'll be best able to help rather than hinder your efforts.
* **Compliance:** Even if your company doesn't release any open source projects, it uses others' open source software. [Awareness and process](https://www.linux.com/blog/why-companies-use-open-source-need-compliance-program) can prevent headaches, product delays, and lawsuits.
* **Patents:** Your company may wish to join the [Open Invention Network](http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/), a shared defensive patent pool to protect members' use of major open source projects, or explore other [alternative patent licensing](https://www.eff.org/document/hacking-patent-system-2016).
* **Governance:** Especially if and when it makes sense to move a project to a [legal entity outside of the company](../../sustaining/leadership/#do-i-need-a-legal-entity-to-support-my-project).
