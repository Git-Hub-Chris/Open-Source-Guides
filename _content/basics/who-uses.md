Many people prefer open source software because they [have more control](/life/13/5/tumblr-open-publishing) over that kind of software. They can examine the code to make sure it's not doing anything they don't want it to do, and they can change parts of it they don't like. Users who aren't programmers also benefit from open source software, because they can use this software for any purpose they wishâ€”not merely the way someone else thinks they should.

Others like open source software because it helps them [become better programmers](/life/13/6/learning-program-open-source-way). Because open source code is publicly accessible, students can learn to make better software by studying what others have written. They can also share their work with others, inviting comment and critique.

Some people prefer open source software because they consider it more [secure](/government/10/9/scap-computer-security-rest-us) and stable than proprietary software. Because anyone can view and modify open source software, someone might spot and correct errors or omissions that a program's original authors might have missed. And because so many programmers can work on a piece of open source software without asking for permission from original authors, open source software is generally fixed, updated, and upgraded [quickly](/government/13/2/bug-fix-day).

Many users prefer open source software to proprietary software for important, long-term projects. Because the source code for open source software [is distributed publicly](/life/12/9/should-we-develop-open-source-openly), users that rely on software for critical tasks can be sure their tools won't disappear or fall into disrepair if their original creators stop working on them.
