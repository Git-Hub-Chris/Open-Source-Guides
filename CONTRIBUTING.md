# Guide for Guides
Welcome to the Guide for Guides!

## How do I help?
We want everyone to feel okay with contributing to anything. Check out the [issues page](https://github.com/github/guides/issues) to see some issues to contribute to. If there's nothing there that piques your interest, you should help us write a guide!

## Working on your laptop
If you want to write code, or write a guide, let's start out with that code on your laptop!

1. Grab the repository: `git clone https://github.com/github/guides`
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b MY-FEATURE`
3. Write your content, fix syntax, add new styles, whatever your change is.
4. When you're ready to get review: `git push -u origin HEAD`
5. Open your pull request and start the conversation
