GitHub Pages are public webpages freely hosted and easily published. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Automatic Page Generator to do the first set of content creation and styling for you. Once created, you have your choice of working in the environment that is most comfortable for you: Web, on your Desktop with GitHub for Windows or Mac apps, or terminal.

When first creating our website, we are presented with the option to change the default content, choose a theme, and finally publishing our website.
