Open source software is written by people just like you.

You don’t need to be a software developer to contribute to an open source project. The code, documentation and artwork that make up an open source project have all been created, tested, used, discussed and refined by members of the project community. These processes can be broken down into a myriad tasks, requiring different skills, levels of involvement and degrees of technical expertise. So, if you want to get involved in an open source project, there is a range of roles to choose from, including:

*   providing feedback
*   helping new users
*   recommending the project to others
*   testing and reporting or fixing bugs
*   requesting new features
*   writing and updating software
*   creating artwork
*   writing or updating documentation
*   translating

All of these contributions help to keep a project active and strengthen the community. The project team and the broader community will therefore welcome and encourage participation, and attempt to make it as easy as possible for people to get involved. The exact roles and mechanisms for participating will be dictated by the project’s [governance model](governanceModels) and vary from one project to another. The tools for communicating within the community and making contributions will also vary.

For most projects, the first step is normally to join one or more of the project mailing lists, depending on your area of interest. Mailing lists are generally the main communication channel, but some projects may also use forums or other tools. The project’s website should provide clear guidelines on how to get started and which channels to use.

Initially, [participating in an open source software community](http://www.oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/toptipscommunities) will be an intimidating prospect. But remember that such communities are ultimately composed of people, with all the virtues and foibles of people everywhere. Everyone involved in the project is working towards a common goal, and useful skills, a bit of effort and some humility will always be welcome. Equally, taking the time to plan your involvement by consulting the project’s website, and getting to know the community by following discussions on the mailing lists, will smooth the path to a successful and fulfilling collaboration.
