Some software has source code that cannot be modified by anyone but the person, team, or organization who created it and maintains exclusive control over it.

This kind of software is frequently called "proprietary software" or "closed source" software, because its source code is the property of its original authors, who are the only ones legally allowed to copy or modify it. Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop are examples of proprietary software. In order to use proprietary software, computer users must agree (usually by signing a license displayed the first time they run this software) that they will not do anything with the software that the software's authors have not expressly permitted.

TODO: proprietary software is almost always built on top of open source

Open source software is different. Its authors [make its source code available](https://opensource.com/business/13/5/open-source-your-code) to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it. [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and the [GNU Image Manipulation Program](http://www.gimp.org/) are examples of open source software. As they do with proprietary software, users must accept the terms of a [license](/law/13/1/which-open-source-software-license-should-i-use) when they use open source software—but the legal terms of open source licenses differ dramatically from those of proprietary licenses. Open source software licenses promote collaboration and sharing because they allow other people to make modifications to source code and incorporate those changes into their own projects. [Some open source licenses](/law/13/5/does-your-code-need-license) ensure that anyone who alters and then shares a program with others must also share that program's source code without charging a licensing fee for it. In other words, computer programmers can access, view, and modify open source software whenever they like—as long as they let others do the same when they share their work. In fact, they could be violating the terms of some open source licenses if they _don't_ do this.

So as the [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/docs/osd) explains, "open source doesn't just mean access to the source code." It means that anyone should be able to _modify_ the source code to suit his or her needs, and that no one should prevent others from doing the same. The Initiative's definition of "open source" contains several other [important provisions](http://opensource.org/docs/osd).
