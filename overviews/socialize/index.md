With more and more people joining GitHub and adding projects every day, keeping up with all of them can be difficult. However, this can be fun and easy by following users or watching repositories, simply showing interest in them by starring, or using explore to find new people and projects.

# Follow a Friend

One of the great features on GitHub is the ability to see what other people are working on and who they are connecting with.
When you follow someone, you'll get notifications about their GitHub activity. You can choose to have these sent via
email or viewable on the web by [configuring your settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications). Following friends
help you find new projects and new people that you may share interest with. You can see what some of your friends are
interested in by looking at [the explore page](https://github.com/explore).

### Step 1: Pick a friend.

Why not follow one of these cool people from GitHub:

Congratulations! You are now following a friend.

# Watch a Project

At some point you may want to stay up-to-date with a specific project. We've made this easy to do.

Our friend the Octocat has a project called [Hello World] [1] that we'd like to watch.

Once you are on the project page, you will notice there is a "watch" button at the top of the page. Click on it.

Congratulations! You are now watching the Hello World project. If the Octocat updates it, you will see what happened in your dashboard.
