title: Getting paid for open source work
---

If you make regular, substantial contributions to open source, or you're just considering your first contribution, you may start to wonder whether anybody gets paid to work on open source.

Today, some open source work is paid. Projects sometimes raise money from companies, individuals, or others to fund ongoing work. [Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/), for example, is a foundation that pays for work on [bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler), [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), and other Ruby infrastructure projects.

For an individual contributor, a company may hire an employee to work on an open source project, or encourage employees to contribute during work hours. [Nodesource](https://github.com/nodesource) and [Rackspace](https://blog.rackspace.com/rackspaces-policy-on-contributing-to-open-source/) are two companies with these types of arrangements.

Other open source work is unpaid or volunteered. For example, someone might come across a bug in a project they use and submit a quick fix, or they might enjoy tinkering with an open source project in their spare time. (Did you know that @gvanrossum started [Python](https://github.com/python) over a Christmas holiday?)

There are plenty of reasons why a person or project would not want to be paid for open source work. They may already have a full-time job that they love, which enables them to contribute to open source in their spare time. Others enjoy thinking of open source as a hobby or creative escape and don't want to feel financially obligated to work on their projects.

For others, getting paid to contribute to open source is the only way they can afford to make it work. Maintaining popular projects can be a significant responsibility, taking up 10 or 20 hours per week instead of a few hours per month.

Paid work also enables people from different walks of life to make meaningful contributions. Some people cannot afford to spend unpaid time on open source projects, based on their current financial position or family obligations. That means the world never sees contributions from talented people who can't afford to volunteer their time.

As open source's popularity increases, availability of funding has not yet caught up to the need. If you are interested in finding funding for your open source work, [there are some options](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) available to you. Here are some examples:

* Raise money for your work through crowdfunding campaigns or donations. This works well if you have a strong audience or reputation already.

* Find a company to hire you to work on your idea, or ask your current employer for dedicated work time.

* Get a grant to work on your project. Some software foundations and companies offer grants for open source work, such as the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/grants/), and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/open-source-retreat-2016).

* If you have a large project, raise sponsorships from companies and individual donors through a software foundation. Or start a business to support the project.

Different types of funding require different skills, so consider your strengths to figure out which funding option works best for you.
