# Guide for Guides
Welcome to the Guide for Guides!

## How do I help?

- File an issue with a proposal for the new guide
  - Attach the label of `guide-suggestion`
- Make sure to cc a domain expert if you aren't one
- Once the guide looks finished, get a :+1: from domain expert and some word smiths over at @github/guides or @github/docs

Just because you wrote the proposal, doesn't mean you have to write the guide. It's up to you!

If there's a guide currently being written you want to help out with, don't be a stranger! Comment on the issue to provide feedback or see if the contributor would love your help

## How should I go about writing a Guide?

- Tell, then show when writing a guide. That means write the text and then show an image

Not all of us are wordsmiths, but that's why we're in this together. If there's something you've stumbled upon that you think should be a guide, follow the [steps below](#working-on-your-laptop) to get the repository down on your computer locally and start writing content.

If there isn't a category folder for your file yet, don't fret. Either create one you think is good, or don't worry about it and we can work this out in the pull request.

### Images
Images should be put in the same directory that you're writing your guide in:

```
![GitHubâ€™s API Developer Site README](masteringmarkdown-github-developer-api-readme.jpg)
```
This way we can render them with Markdown AND they're easier to keep track of for updating. Since `masteringmarkdown-github-developer-api-readme.jpg` lives in the same directory as the Markdown file referencing it, we can just call the file by name in the parenthesis part of the image Markdown.

## Working on your laptop
If you want to write code, or write a guide, let's start out with that code on your laptop!

1. Grab the repository: `git clone https://github.com/github/guides`
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b MY-FEATURE`
3. Write your content, fix syntax, add new styles, whatever your change is.
4. When you're ready to get review: `git push -u origin HEAD`
5. Open your pull request and start the conversation

## Determining your guide's order

Open up the *_config.yml* file in the root of the *guides* folder, and you'll see some funny looking code that looks like this:

```yml
organization:
  - /introduction/flow/index.html
  - /introduction/desktop/index.html
  - /activities/contributing-to-open-source/index.html
  - /activities/forking/index.html
  - /activities/socialize/index.html
  - /features/issues/index.html
  - /features/mastering-markdown/index.html
```

Those paths determine how the landing page for Guides is ordered. (Jekyll gleefully fetches whatever it can, so sometimes the front page gets reshuffled when the site is built.)

Add a path to your new guide wherever you see fit!
