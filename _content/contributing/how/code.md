As a software developer, your first step towards contributing code will probably be reporting bugs and submitting fixes. If you are not yet a committer on the project, you would normally make these contributions by submitting a patch on the issue tracker. You might then go on to design new features for the project or redesign or develop current ones.

Remember that all significant code contributions should be discussed on the developer mailing list before implementation. This will allow the project team to ensure that the design is appropriate and that user experience will not be adversely affected. Smaller contributions, such as bug fixes, can be submitted as patches on the issue tracker without discussion.
