Everything on GitHub revolves around code. And chances are if you're joining GitHub, you've got some code that you might want to push to GitHub. Here's some reasons you should put your project on GitHub:

* **Version Control** — Everything on GitHub is stored in [Git]http://git-scm.com/, the best version control system around. Version control allows you to  experiment and make mistakes in code without messing up your final product.

* **Keep your code in one place** — Whether you work on multiple computers, or just want to get some old projects off your hard drive, GitHub the perfect place to store your projects online.

* **Collaboration** — Once your code is on GitHub, you can invite others to work on your code with you. Send them a link to help you debug a problem

Once your project is on GitHub, we provide a linkable interface for every file in your project. This is Mike Bostock's popular [d3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) project for javascript base data-driven documents.

## GitHub Desktop

GitHub for Desktop is the easiest way to get code on GitHub — you won't need to learn any command line instructions, SSH keys, or complicated Git terminology. All you'll need is your Mac or Windows computer and a [GitHub.com account](https://github.com/join).

You can download GitHub Desktop for **[Mac](http://mac.github.com)** and **[Windows](http://windows.github.com)**. Once you install GitHub Desktop, a short set up wizard will walk you through some basic configuration and give you the chance to connect GitHub Desktop with your GitHub.com account.

## Set up your project in GitHub Desktop

The easiest way to get your project into GitHub Desktop is to drag the folder with your code in it into the main application screen.

If you drag in an existing Git repository, you can skip ahead to the [Push your code to GitHub.com](#pushit) section. If the folder isn't a Git repository yet, the application will allow you to turn it into a repository. Turning your project into a Git repository won't delete or ruin the files in your folder — it'll just create some hidden files that allow Git to do it's magic.

### Your first commit

All Git repositories are based on *commits* — snapshots of your code at a point in time. Before you can push your code up to GitHub, you need to make at least one commit.

Navigate to the changes tab and press **Commit** to create your first commit. Every time you change files and want to remember that point in time, you'll need to create a new commit.

Make as many commits as you like locally — no one but you can see commits that aren't pushed.

## Push your code to GitHub.com

Once your code is in a good place, it's time to push it to GitHub. Press the "Push to GitHub" button in the top right corner, and GitHub Desktop will ask you what kind of repository to push this as.

* **Public repositories**  — Anyone can see this repository, but only you can choose who can commit to the repository. Public repositories are unlimited and free on GitHub.

* **Private repositories** — You choose who can see and commit to this repository. No one can know about the repository unless you tell them about it. Private repositories require a [paid subscription](https://github.com/settings/billing) on GitHub.

## Celebrate!

And… your'e done! Now that your project is on GitHub, you can start exploring some of the [awesome things you can do with repositories](https://github.com/features).
