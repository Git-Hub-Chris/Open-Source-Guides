GitHub Pages are public webpages freely hosted and easily published. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Automatic Page Generator to do the first set of content creation and styling for you. Once created, you have your choice of working in the environment that is most comfortable for you: Web, on your Desktop with GitHub for Windows or Mac apps, or terminal.

When first creating our website, we are presented with the option to change the default content, choose a theme, and finally publishing our website.

## Create Your Website

Once we're <a href="https://github.com/login" target="_blank">signed in</a> we can create a special named repository for our website.

This repository, `username.github.io`, will be where all of the HTML and CSS lives that makes up our website. GitHub is going to generate this initial code for us from the settings tab.

Scrolling down near the bottom of the options, we see a button labeled "Automatic Page Generator". Clicking this will start off the process for our content being automatically created for us.

When we click this, we're directed to the first step of generating the page: The Content. We can go ahead and keep this default content and make changes to it later. Let's go ahead and click `Continue to Layouts`

Now, we pick our theme. This part requires a bit more thought, as the style we choose is slightly harder to update later. Take a look at some of the options at the top, and when you find one you love, click Publish at the top.

Once we click publish, GitHub does all the work to ensure when someone navigates to `username.github.io` it directs to your new website. This can take up to 10 minutes. After some time passes, feel free to open a new tab in your browser and go to your website!
