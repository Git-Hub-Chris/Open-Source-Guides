The lifeblood of any open source project is its users: more users means more opportunities for success. And feedback from users on what they want helps to ensure that the product is of increasingly good quality. So it is vital that the project attracts users on an ongoing basis. As an existing user, you can help the project to do this by telling people about it and encouraging them to try it out.

The project may also engage in more active forms of marketing, such as representation at conferences and workshops. By being willing to present the project to others, you can also help to ensure that a flow of users, and thus potential contributors, is maintained.
