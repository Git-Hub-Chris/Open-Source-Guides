title: Enforcing your code of conduct
---

Your code of conduct helps create a healthy and constructive social atmosphere for your project's community. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, somebody will do something that violates this code. In this section, we'll talk about how to address negative or harmful behavior in your project's community.

### Write down how you'll enforce your code of conduct

You should explain how your code of conduct will be enforced **_before_** a violation occurs. There are several reasons for this:

* Tying values to action turns the code of conduct from a philosophy into a policy. It demonstrates that you are serious about enforcing the code of conduct.

* You will empower your community by explaining how to report a violation and assuring them their complaint will be reviewed.

* Community members will feel reassured that there is a clear review process if they are ever investigated for a violation. As with any other aspect of managing an open source project, transparent communication helps prevent decisions from being made by a few people behind closed doors.

You should give people a private way (such as an email address) to report a code of conduct violation and explain who receives that report. It could be a maintainer, a group of maintainers, or a code of conduct working group.

Don't forget that someone might want to report a violation about someone who usually receives those reports. In this case, give them an option to report violations to someone else. For example, @ctb and @mr-c explain on their project, [Khmer](https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer):

> Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by emailing **khmer-project@idyll.org** which only goes to C. Titus Brown and Michael R. Crusoe. To report an issue involving either of them please email **Judi Brown Clarke, Ph.D.** the Diversity Director at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action, an NSF Center for Science and Technology.* [^1]

### Gather information about the situation

Treat each community member's voice as important as your own. If you receive a report that someone has violated the code of conduct, take it seriously and investigate the matter, even if it does not match your own experience with that person. Doing so sends a signal to members of your community that you value their perspective and trust their judgment.

The community member in question may be a repeat offender who consistently makes others feel uncomfortable, or they may have only said or done something once. Both can be grounds for taking action, depending on context.

Before you respond, give yourself time to understand what happened. Read through the person's past comments and conversations to better understand who they are and why they might have acted in such a way. Try to gather perspectives from other community members about this person and their behavior.

### Take appropriate action

When you feel you sufficiently understand the context of the situation, you'll need to decide what to do. As you consider your next steps, remember that your goal as a moderator is to foster a safe, respectful, and collaborative environment. Consider not only how to deal with the situation in question, but how your response will affect the rest of your community's behavior and expectations moving forward.

Remember that when somebody reports a code of conduct violation, it is your, not their, job to handle it. Sometimes, the reporter is disclosing information at great risk to their career, reputation, or physical safety. Forcing them to confront their harasser could put the reporter in a compromising position. You should handle direct communication with the person in question, unless the reporter explicitly requests otherwise.

Here are some ways you might respond to a code of conduct violation:

* Give the person in question a public warning and explaining how their behavior negatively impacted others, preferably in the channel where it occurred. Where possible, public communication helps convey to the rest of the community that you take the code of conduct seriously. Be kind, but firm in your communication.

* Privately reach out to the person in question to explain how they violated the code of conduct and how their behavior negatively impacted others. You may want to use a private communication channel if the situation involves sensitive personal information. If you communicate with someone privately, it's a good idea to CC those who first reported the situation, so they know you responded. Ask the reporting person for consent first before CCing them into your response.

Sometimes, a resolution cannot be reached. The person in question may become aggressive or hostile when confronted or does not change their behavior. In this situation, you may want to consider taking stronger action. For example:

* Suspend the person in question from the project, enforced through a temporary ban on participating in any aspect of the project

* Permanently ban the person from the project

Banning members should not be taken lightly and represents a permanent and irreconcilable difference of perspectives. You should only take these measures towards a community member when it is clear that a resolution cannot be reached.

It's not always easy to enforce your code of conduct, but this type of work is necessary to maintain a healthy and active community. When a project seems hostile or unwelcoming, even if it's just one person whose behavior is tolerated by the rest of the community, you risk losing the contributions of many others, some of whom you may never even meet.
