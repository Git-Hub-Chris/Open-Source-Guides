# Open Source Handbook

This handbook is a collection of resources to help individual, communities, and companies sustainably embrace open source software. It explains not only how to accomplish a task, but why youâ€™d want to, and how that task fits into the larger story of consuming, contributing to, and producing open source software.

This handbook aims to foster healthy open source communities, and provide a canonical place for the community to discuss and codify best practices into highly-approachable resources.
