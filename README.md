GitHub Guides is the place to come to learn about the GitHub Universe™.
From time to time you’ll see references to a beloved book,
The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams.
If you haven’t read it, don’t panic.

## Backstory

We currently have materials for learning and teaching Git and GitHub
spread out over multiple web properties. This confuses and frustrates people.
GitHub Guides will solve this problem by becoming the canonical repository for
consolidating existing materials from learn.github.com, teach.github.com,
training.github.com, the GitHub Help bootcamp, and creating new materials
when necessary.

## People

These are the people you should get in touch with if you have questions.
