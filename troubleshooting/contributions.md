title: Handling contributions you don't want to accept
---

As a maintainer of an open source project, you'll inevitably receive contributions that you don't want to accept. Maybe the contribution changes your project's scope or doesn't match your vision. Maybe the idea is good, but the implementation is poor.

Regardless of the reason, here are some strategies to tactfully handle contributions that don't meet your project's standards.

### Say something!

If you receive a contribution you don't want to accept, your first reaction might be to ignore it or pretend you didn't see it. Doing so could hurt the other person's feelings and even demotivate other potential contributors in your community.

Contributing to an open source project can be intimidating, especially if it's someone's first time. Even if you don't accept their contribution, be sure to respond to their submission. Acknowledge the person behind it and thank them for their interest. It's a big compliment! If you don't want to accept the contribution, clearly explain why and offer suggestions for improvement if you're able.

Don't feel guilty about not wanting to accept someone's contribution. While empathizing with another person's enthusiasm is a good thing, rejecting a contribution is not the same as rejecting the person behind it. Your potential contributor may get upset or criticize your decision. If their behavior becomes hostile, take steps to diffuse the situation or even [remove them from your community](../conduct), if they're not willing to collaborate constructively.

### Write down what you won't accept beforehand

Having a clear contribution policy helps depersonalize situations where you don't want to accept a contribution. Saying "Your contribution doesn't match this project's criteria" feels less personal than "I don't like your contribution". In addition, clear contribution policies can reduce the chances that someone will submit something you don't want in the first place.

### Ask that people discuss major changes first

In your contributing guide, explain your project's process for submitting and accepting contributions. Many projects specify that if someone is proposing a major change, that they open an issue first before doing any work. This policy reduces the chances that someone will put in many wasted hours of work into a pull request that you aren't going to accept. And, if someone does make an unexpected pull request, you can point to your policy and say that major changes need to be discussed first.

### Require tests and other checks to improve the quality of code

Set up automatic tests that will run on all incoming contributions, and ensure that your tests can easily be run locally by contributors. Require that all code contributions pass your tests before they can be submitted. You'll help set a minimum standard of quality for all submissions. You can also emphasize the use of style guides, linters, and other tools to help people meet your quality standards.

### Mentor, or find a mentor for, your contributor

Maybe someone in your community regularly submits contributions that don't meet your project's standards. It can be frustrating for both parties to repeatedly go through rejections.

If you see that someone is enthusiastic about your project, but needs a bit of polish, be patient. Explain clearly in each situation why their contributions don't meet the expectations of the project. Try pointing them to an easier or less ambiguous task, like an issue marked "good first bug," to get their feet wet. If you have the time, you can even mentor them through their first contribution, or find someone else in your community who might be willing to mentor them.

Ultimately, if a contribution isn't good enough, remember that you are under no obligation to accept it. Be kind and responsive when people contribute to your project, but only accept changes that you truly believe will make your project better.

### Encourage people to work on their own versions

If a potential contributor has a very different view on what your project should do, you may want to gently encourage them to work on their own fork. Forking a project doesn't have to be a bad thing - forking can be one of the best things about open source! Encouraging your community members to work on their own fork can provide the creative outlet they need, without conflicting with your project's vision.
